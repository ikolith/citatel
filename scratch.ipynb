      "+2 when looking using your PER to watch for specific and brief events. You can use this to watch for a positive or negative reaction when you give another character new information, or you can watch to see if another character will try to draw a weapon, allowing you to draw yours first. Keen allows you not only to react quickly, but to anticipate actions and act first. Add +2 to your passive resistance to stealth and pickpocketing.  \n",
      "*You are able to focus your perception to a razors edge, catching the briefest movement. Like a poker player spotting the telltale dilation of pupils as a card is dealt, or a watchman high on a tower watching for movement below. When you know what you are looking for, it's almost as if time slows down for you for just a moment.*  \n",

Once you use Rumination, you have to rest before you can use it again. You can use Rumination any time you can take a moment just to think.  \n",
      "*You deeply ponder a question. You turn what you have seen and heard over in your mind, without judgement or bias. You dredge up minute details from your memory that may have, at the time, slipped past your conscious awareness. You approach your problem from all angles, crafting and discarding theories. You are fishing for an epiphany, a sudden flash of realization.*  \n",
      "For GMs: This can be a difficult skill to work with! When a character uses this skill, they only get information that they have already seen or information that they “could” have seen. Give out new information sparingly with this ability! New pieces of information should be very small. Maybe a look from another character that didn't seem like anything at the time, but is strange or out of place in hindsight. If a player has so much information the answer is staring them in the face and they get heads, at least try to give them the information slowly so they have a chance to figure it out, maybe text it to them separately so they can present their eureka moment to the rest of the party themselves.\n",

Once you use Wild Conjecture, you have to rest before you can use it again.  \n",

      "Before you take this skill, establish with the GM how you want to receive the theory. The GM could, in secret, gives you a series of “beats” to hit or facts to include along with a conclusion. Then, you roleplay and improvise the connecting tissue of the theory. Alternatively, the GM just tells you the theory. You could do something else entirely. The GM could just drop an earth shattering revelation that has a 50% chance of being false. If you're the GM and a player uses Wild Conjecture on a question they have insufficient information for and they get heads, get creative. Give them some little tidbit related to the answer, push them down the right track, confuse them. \n",
