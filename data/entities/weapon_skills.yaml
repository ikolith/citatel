## [Severing]
- name: Butchery I
  requirements: 1 STR
  effect: "When you roll matching dice with a [Severing] weapon, do 1 crit damage and apply apply an Injury that disables one of the enemy's limbs."
  # this is "matching" with the requirement that the roll passes, which i dont want to have to specify every single time. Should "matching" be "[matching]"? should brackets be used to express that something is a keyword? {} is for entities, [] was for tags, now its not i think, but it is for damage types...
  # maybe rules and context are entities??? so they can be followed??? certainly poison cards and such will be entities so they can be printed.
  # How should the effect of Injury be specified?
  # the head is not a limb
