# General

- name: "Strain"
  effect: Once per turn, you can spend 1 AP to do something that would otherwise require more AP. If you do this, note the difference between the AP paid and AP spent as an AP debt. At the beginning of every following round (or until initiative ends), the first AP card you draw must be spent to pay off the AP debt.
