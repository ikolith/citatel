    The dogmen of the hills travel in packs. They care for nothing and no one besides their pack. They are immune to ideas like nations and news from far off places. They are deaf to the words of people they will never meet. Their hearts and minds are closed to abstractions and alien dreams. Dogmen cannot consider hypotheticals, they do not worry, they do not lie. They will attack you on the road, take your things, feed you to their pack, boil your bones for broth, then chew on what's left. All will be right, all will be as it should be.

    They are gangly hunched little weirdos with scrubby yellow fur, big beady black eyes, saggy stretchy skin, and floppy ears that are always twitching, tucking, pointing, turning, always out of sync with one another.

    When not attacking travelers they craft surprisingly nice drums of all shapes and sizes with which they accompany their hungry howling. They are remarkably good leatherworkers, all things considered.
