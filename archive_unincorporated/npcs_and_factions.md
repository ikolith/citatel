Most NPCs at this point, especially if they were created created early on, are pretty straightforwardly "evil" or at least hostile. This is because I needed to test combat and I needed some more NPCs with a little less nuance, NPCs that would start fights immediately. As things progress one would hope they get a little more well rounded.

Additionally, the vast majority of NPCs will have no entry here, they'll only have an entry in npcs.yaml. If you want to make your own NPCs, check out the .yaml Entity Creation page heres where a linnk would go but this doc is archived
