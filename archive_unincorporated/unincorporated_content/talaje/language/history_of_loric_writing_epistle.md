Pseudo-Moron‚Äôs Treatise on the forms of the Loric Writing System:

[[These double brackets are author notes (by me, not the fictional author of the fictional letter), and single brackets communicate something about the textual document you would find in-game.]]

[[The first part of this document is typeset like it would be in the original, except with English punctuation marks: in particular, left and right commas are parentheses. ¬∂ (pilcrow) would be the end of paragraph marker, and ‚àé (tombstone) the end of text marker (I have used tombstone due to its use in English as an end of text marker as well). ‚êÉ or ‚êÑ (end-of- text, transmission control code representation characters) could also be used as the end of text character, if you were insane.]]

[[In this world, ; is a text attribution marker. You can use it at the end or beginning of quotes, and you use it with your name at the beginning of letters you are writing, instead of signing at the bottom.]]

Moron of Sabis;

Lavirnee--you wish to know what has come of my research in the archives to which you have sent me. Here is what I have found--

Loric began (as far as we can tell--as far back as we can go) with Proto-Loric--which was only spoken. From this arose Old Loric--on which I shall not dwell. Old Loric (it must be known) was written in cursive, hugging close to an invisible top line--and without vowels--but with the longination dots. The only punctuation was the em dash (--) tho at that time it was written as (:--) and the recursive form now seen in rarefied High Loric was rarely seen -- the space ( ) tho this was occasionally disregarded -- and the veneration marks which were properly used for the names of kings and such and not just any proper noun.

[[I have stopped doing our fictional punctuation system now because lazy.]]

Eventually, the wiseman Moron the Great invented both punctuation and vowels. Short vowels were, as they are now, written below the line and the ascended vowels were written above the line. The ascended form of the vowel, being not inverted like the short vowels, are seen as the canonical form for the shape of the letter, presumably because Moron first used diacritics to mark long vowels. The h diacritic was also added then, and the initial vowels and h clusters were written above an empty (null) consonant‚Äîalthough this was mostly thought of as not writing anything and writing the diacritic about that. He invented the period, the pondering, the confusion, the left comma and right comma. The silly period, its child the sarcastic period, and the end-of-paragraph and end-of-text period were later innovations.

It should be noted that Moron also created a sixth vowel diacritic, an explicit null vowel marker for when a consonant is not followed by any vowel. This is rarely seen anymore. He placed it above, like a long vowel, But either placement can be seen throughout history, when this form has been bothered to be used.

[[fictional punctuation system again for the next paragraph]]

(side note--please stop calling me Pseudo-Moron--i am not pretending to be moron--I simply have the same name. I am from the city of Sabis-- where the name is still somewhat common. (I understand (in your part of the world) a man named Bartleby the Lapine ((bugs bunny)) popularized the sarcastic usage of the appellation (Moron) so the name is no longer common--but it is a name)).

Moron's ^ was actually a triangle of sorts with a very concave bottom, hence why the big vowel form introduced for printing has a crossbar (as well as to distinguish it from the big vowel mark /). For normal text, however, this fine detail has been lost to time‚Äîand indeed would damage the comprehension of the small mark.

In this period, the interrobang (‚ÄΩ) was invented [page missing] I hope that clears that up.

[[This section has a number of new words in it, invented to describe the aspects of the writing system's letterforms. They are not typos, but the terminology is not set in stone yet.]]

The print era led to a great shift in Loric, as the printing press introduced the straightive. Johannes etc Gutenberg of Loria‚Äôs original print form included a unifying, structural line over all marks and spaces, including the constants and the vowels and longination dots, which were also letterized (converted from diacritics to full, standalone letters) and monospaced with the same width as the consonants. Note: the consonants connect to the line, but the vowels and longations don't.

In unlinated straigtive used by later printers, the top line was removed altogether. Another variant seen sometimes is semi-linated, in which only consonants receive the overline.

The fashion is, among the uneducated‚Äîand, unfortunately, increasingly in the offspring of the uppercrust‚Äîto backport the overline of linated straightive to the writing of cursive by hand, out of a misplaced piousness. The result is a cursive text with a completely superfluous and unsightly overline resting on slightly above the structural (invisible) line of continuity in the cursive writing. May this practice one day find ceasation!

Gutenberg printed with as many clarifying marks as possible, to make the writing as clear as possible to the audience, as they were not used to the new medium. However, as printing matured, many people began printing without vowels nor longation mark‚Äîas seen usually in handwriting. Some enterprising printers printed, by clever means, with diacritical punctuation (vowels and longation) inserted as it would be in cursive, and some even printed in cursive using advanced printing presses.

Also, straightive was sometimes written by hand by now, with overline and without line, and with or without vowels and longation.

The former circular or approximately-circular base form of the period, and all its derivatives, changed to a downwards-pointing triangle ‚ñΩ or the slimmer ‚àá in the print era, to avoid ambiguity between the period, the o vowel, and the v consonant.

The fleuron ‚ù¶ and jovaun symbol ùîä were also codified in the print era.
