title: Why Code?
---

## Do I need to interact with any code or computers to play this game?

**No.** You can download and print the rules and any documentation. You can download and print pre-made card sets or entity documentation. You can ignore [templating](./templating.md) and just roll the dice and find the mentioned entities yourself. You don't need an internet connection or a computer or any of that.

## Why is the Code here then?

The code is here to make your life easier. It's here to give you more options, to automate dice rolling and searching (to the degree that you want to automate that stuff) to enable you to quickly and easily modify the game or content, add your own content, and write your own tooling if you want to. All of the original tools used to make the game are available and you can use that to do whatever you want in your own game without having to manually extract or copy data, worry about getting sued, or anything like that. All of the original data is here and any changes or updates will be immediately available.

## Alright, so where do I download the full book and the cards?

TODO:  
Ahhh... playtesting and content creation is still very much in progress. Your best bet is *still* to just generate docs from the current state of the repo, sorry. I'm working on making sure that there are always up-to-date cards and documentation available for download, generated every time a change is made. Of course, there are many many other things to do, changes to make, content to write. I recommend just keeping up with development, using the Discord bot if you don't want to interact with code (hosted jupyter notebook for command access kept in step with the repo at some point???).

You may ask: Why are you spending so much time on code, then?  
Because I quit my job and if I'm going to work on this goofy nonsense I should probably make sure I have some code to show for it so I can maybe get a real job when I inevitably run out of money. Also, I enjoy it.
