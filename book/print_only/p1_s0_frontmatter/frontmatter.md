This section is really only important for the printed book

Here goes the typical frontmatter stuff, table of contents, etc.  More importantly this is where a summary of the structure of the book should be presented. Ideally that will be done as early as possible. This should express to the reader what parts they should or should not read according to their preferences re:spoilers, context, time, etc.

Frontmatter will be written after everything else, as it is mostly context and navigation. Need something to give context to!
