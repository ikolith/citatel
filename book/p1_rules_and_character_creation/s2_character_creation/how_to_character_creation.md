The base sheet for a human character looks like this:

HP: 18 + (6\*CON), Defense: 6, Movement Speed: 4  

| ATTRIBUTE      | SCORE |
| -------------- | ----- |
| STR(ENGTH)     | 0     |
| AGI(LITY)      | 0     |
| DEX(TERITY)    | 0     |
| CON(STITUTION) | 0     |
| PER(CEPTION)   | 0     |
| SOC(IAL)       | 0     |

The base sheet for other species in Talaje might have different attributes and scores, different base HP, defense, and movement speeds, as well as unique skills. These options are covered in the [LINK THE SPECIES SHOPPING SECTION HERE BUT IN A BETTER WAY](shopping.md) section.

Defense, HP, and movement speed can't be changed directly. CON influences HP. Defense can be raised by actions like “Dodge” and it can be lowered by bulky armor. Skills and conditions can be used to alter all three qualities from the base sheet, but the base sheet remains the same.

## Increasing Your Scores
You can increase your scores at any time using skill points. <!--  TODO: I still don't like this, and very likely skill points and score points will become different things, somehow! I dont know! --> The cost of increasing a score from 0 to 1 is 1, the cost of going from 1 to 2 is 2, 2 to 3 is 3, etc. The cost of increasing from X to Y is Y. So, going directly from 0 to 3 costs 1+2+3, or 6 SP.  To go up from a negative score to the next score only costs 1 SP.

How much does it cost to go from 0 straight to…?

| Score | SP Cost |
| ----- | ------- |
| 1     | 1       |
| 2     | 3       |
| 3     | 6       |
| 4     | 10      |
| 5     | 15      |

## Character Creation

Character creation allows you to modify the basic character sheet, add skills, create a backstory, choose starting equipment, etc. There are two primary ways of doing this, point buy and randomization. Point buy is the simplest and it uses the same mechanics that are used throughout the game to increase scores and buy skills so it will be explained first.

### Determining Attribute Scores

#### Point Buy

You get some number of skill points (SP) to spend at character creation; how many points is determined by how exactly you want to start your game, TTYGM. Starting with 0 points to spend is good for a longer campaign where you want to start as entirely mundane commoners -- you might even start with negative points. 9 SP is a good amount to start with to create semi-competent adventurers. Remember that you can spend SP on either scores or skills, the SP cost of a skill and any prerequisites are listed along with the skill.
 
You can lower a standard score to -1 to get a point out of it, you can only do this to 3 standard scores at character creation.
<!-- im considering that it may be a lot more interesting to make more negative scores worse... where... i guess you would have to pay the price of the negative score you are leaving... so -2 -> -1 would be 2 points. -->

#### Randomized Attribute Scores

Alternatively, you can generate a random character by rolling dice for every score. You can decide with your group whether you want to go down your list of stats in order, starting by rolling to determine STR, then AGI, etc, or if you want to roll 6 dice and then be allowed to allocate them however you want. Choosing your allocation obviously makes it much easier to have a cohesive "build".  

#### A Couple of Randomization Schemes

To determine stats at the start of the game, I suggest you either use d4-2 or d6-3. d6-3 is straightforwardly "better" than rolling d4-2. d6-3 is statistically equivalent to putting 1.5 SP into each score. If you are just rolling for the core skills, that's a total value of 6 \* 1.5 = 9. d4-2 is equivalent to 0.75 SP per score, or 6 \* 0.75 = 4.5 (more explanation of this is in the [EXTRA RULES?? WHAT IS THIS CALLED]() section). Given that standard point buy gets 9, I would give randomized characters 4 or 5 points to spend on skills, depending on how competent you want your character to be right at the beginning of the game.

I recommend rolling d4-2 to determine starting attributes. It gives characters a bit more room to grow and develop during the game. d6-3 will mean that you will likely get a 3 in some stat, which is so valuable it could quickly define your character before you've had a chance to play them.
