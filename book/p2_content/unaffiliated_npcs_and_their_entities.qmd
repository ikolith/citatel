This page involves some automation that I'm still dialing in, so the formatting isn't exactly what I want it to be. Also, many NPCs are missing, and most that are here need to be cleaned up. 

```{python}
import os
from citutils import (text_utils_parsers as tu, 
    entity_text_generators as ge)

text = ""
entities = tu.get_entities(os.path.join("..","..","data","entities"))

entities_to_generate = dict(sorted({
    "legion":{"include_full_text":True,"skip_generation":True},
    "tchok":{"include_full_text":True},
    }.items()))

# probably this nonsense becomes a function at some point... if i decide this is how i want to automate stuff
for clean_name, kwargs in entities_to_generate.items():
    text+= ("## " + entities[clean_name]["name"] + "\n\n" + 
        ge.generate_entity_text(entity = entities[clean_name],**kwargs))

print(text)
```
