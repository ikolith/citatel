# BOOK II

At a high level, this goes from more generic to less.  
Important in this section to be able to jump around *in relative safety* from spoilers. Also, in the notes for this was stored the idea of some lore gated behind some kind of LORE or KNOWLEDGE score. Required reading for skill upgrades, yay?!

At several points I'll be referring to a "Standard Block". This is a repeated sorting of entities of various types, so that weapons, skills, etc are all presented in a consistent order. This block looks like:

- Skills
- Weapons
- Shields
- Armor
- Invocations
- Other Items  


## SECTION 1: "Game Stuff"

Notably, Section 1 is nearly all programmatically generated!

### Unaffiliated "Entities"

- "Standard Block"

### Unaffiliated NPCs and Their "Entities"

- "Standard Block"

### Peoples, or Group-Type Sections
- Lore
- "Standard Block"
- NPCs
- Unique NPCs and their unique "things"

## SECTION 2: Mechanical Reference/Aggregation

Ending with a series of indexes separated by "type of thing" that lists page numbers of all weapons, skills, etc.
