title: Character Sheets, Handouts, Downloads

Downloads have moved since the site was rebuilt. 

TODO: Regenerate the downloads and link them.

<!-- Character sheet available for download [here](TODO: NEWLINK).

A new handout with universal/standard skills will be made available once I revise the old one.  

Card sets are available for download [here](TODO: NEWLINK) in the repo. The standard card sets are not stable, so seems better to link to where the cards live rather than try to list all of the card sets here. -->
