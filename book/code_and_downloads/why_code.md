title: Why Code?
---

## Do I need to interact with any code or computers to play this game?

**No.** You can download and print the rules and any documentation. You can download and print pre-made card sets or entity documentation. You can ignore [templating](./templating.md) and just roll the dice and find the mentioned entities yourself. You don't need an internet connection or a computer or any of that.

## Why is the Code here then?

The code is here to make your life easier. It's here to give you more options, to automate dice rolling and searching (to the degree that you want to automate that stuff) to enable you to quickly and easily modify the game or content, add your own content, and write your own tooling if you want to. All of the original tools used to make the game are available and you can use that to do whatever you want in your own game without having to manually extract or copy data, worry about getting sued, or anything like that. All of the original data is here and any changes or updates will be immediately available.
