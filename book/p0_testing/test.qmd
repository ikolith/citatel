There are various python doc automation functions I want to be able to use. I'll test them here.

<!-- ```{python}
# testing snippets, some from update.py, some from scratch.py
import os

from citutils import text_utils_parsers as tu
from citutils import entity_text_generators as ge

entities = tu.get_entities(os.path.join("..", "..","data", "entities_test","table"))
print(ge.generate_entity_text(entities["end_table"]))
``` -->

```{python}
import os
from pprint import pprint

from citutils import (
    text_utils_parsers as tu,
    dice_utils as du,
    entity_text_generators as ge,
    commands as co,
)

entities = tu.get_entities(os.path.join("..", "..","data", "entities_test", "table"))
# print(tu.parse_curlies("asdasdf {2d6 adjust man 1d10+2}"))
# print(ge.generate_entity_text(entities["adjust_man"]))
print(
    tu.generate_entity_tree_text(
        entities, tu.parse_curlies("asdasdf {2d1 end_table 1d10+2}")[0], True, False
    )
)

```
