These are the actlite rules. They are very condensed, there are no examples, there is little clarification. This doc will be continuously edited and updated as the rules for actlite are revised. I am doing it this way because having a longer more complete rules document slows the rate at which I can make dramatic and ill-advised changes. Think of this as a quickstart ruleset.

## Characters

Character sheet for a "baseline adventurer":

**HEALTH: 3:9** 

**DEFENSE: 6** 

**MOVEMENT SPEED: 4**

| ATTRIBUTE      | SCORE |
| -------------- | ----- |
| STR(ENGTH)     | 0     |
| AGI(LITY)      | 0     |
| DEX(TERITY)    | 0     |
| CON(STITUTION) | 0     |
| PER(CEPTION)   | 0     |
| SOC(IAL)       | 0     |

### Health

Health is X:Y where X is standard health and Y is critical or "crit" health. When a character runs out of standard health, subsequent damage is to crit health. When a character runs out of crit health they are downed and will probably die. One could expect children and the elderly to have health closer to 1:~3. ~5:~12 would make you extremely tough.

Every point of CON gives you 1 extra crit health and 2 extra standard health.

### Defense and Movement Speed

Moving costs 1 AP and you move a number of spaces equal to your MOVEMENT. When an enemy rolls to hit you, they roll a check against your DEFENSE.

## Scores

Scores are added to all sorts of rolls, checks, modifiers, the passive score, etc.   Your "passive" score for a given score is 6 + SCORE. There is not a strict limit to how many different attributes or scores a character or setting can have.

### Missing Scores, [special] scores

If you're asked about a score you don't have, your score is 0, unless that score is a [special] score. If you don't have a [special] score you fail any check, contest, roll, whatever related to that score. The [sp] tag is just a shorter version of the [special] tag. MEDICINE is not a [special] score, but PYROMANCY is.

#### "Standard" Scores

"Standard Scores" are a convention for non-[sp] scores that are important for the current setting. This is just a convention, not a strict rule. Some settings might emphasize a TECHNOLOGY score, others might not use that score at all.

## Doing things

When you do something roll 2d6s and add the relevant score. Tell your result to the DM to find out how your attempt went.

### "Check" vs "Contest" 

If one character is rolling to try to do something, that's a check. If two character's are rolling in direct competition, that's a contest. Most rolls are checks. Attacks are checks.

## Crits and More

Terminology. All of these refer to the numbers rolled during some check or contest. These only count if the total passes the difficulty, if you succeed. If the difficulty is 8, matching 2s is just a failure.  
Only the Crit and Crit Fail are "universal". The rest are triggered by skills, weapons, etc.

**Crit**: Rolling two 6s.  

**Crit Fail**: Rolling two 1s.  

**Matching**: Matching numbers.  

**Half Crit**: Rolling one 6.  

Yes, a Crit also counts as "Matching".  
Why have all of these special terms and conditions to check? Differing probabilities!

### You Can Probablity Skip This Section  

A roll of two d6s can resolve in 36 different ways, 36 combinations of dice. I will refer to these as "cases". Assuming a roll of 7 passes (most common DC), 21 of these cases pass (sum to >=7).

| Condition | Passing Cases | Percentage of Passing Cases | Percentage of all Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crit | 1 | 4.8% | 2.8% |
| Crit Fail | 0 | 0% | 2.8% |
| Matching | 3 | 14.29% | 8.3% |
| Half Crit | 6 | 28.6% | 16.7% |

Didn't verify this. Winged it. Might be wrong.

### Crit and Crit Fail

Crit Fails are maximally bad. You did as bad as you could do (~3% probability).  

Double 6s are good. You did as good as you could have. If this is an attack roll, do 1 extra crit damage. 

## Initiative and AP

You have 3 AP cards, you use AP to do things. Most things cost 1 AP, you can a reasonable amount of simple things like talking for free.

**Table Deck**: The deck of cards that the DM (or whoever) draws from during initiative. The deck that the whole table uses.  

**Table Discard**: The discard pile for the whole table.  

**Table Cards**: Each character's personal set of cards that they add to the table deck when initiative starts.  

**Hand**: The cards that you have been dealt and are holding on to.  

**Discard/Pay/Spend**: Cards that have been used or removed that go to the discard and are shuffled together next round to make the table deck.  

**Trashed/Removed**: Cards that have been used or removed and do not get shuffled back in every round.  

**Trash**: The trash pile for the whole table.  

Every character has 3 identical cards. The cards say "1 AP" and indicate what character they belong to.  

When initiative starts all characters pass their table sets to the DM. The DM shuffles them together. The DM pulls a card from the top of the deck and deals the card to the character/player that it belongs to. When a character is dealt a card they can choose to act, spending however many cards they want to. They can also just hold on to the card. Cards that are not spent by the end of the round are discarded and shuffled back in.  

If you want to act, speak up before the DM moves on!  
You can spend 1 AP at any time to act immediately.  

### Multiple->AP->Costs

Some types of actions also have multiple AP costs. The first time you do the thing in a round it costs the first amount, the second time it costs the second, etc. These costs are connected with arrows, like this: 1->2->3.

#### AP Shenanigans: Temp AP, Losing AP, Gaining AP, the "Wait" action

"Temp AP" must be spend in the same round it is recieved. If you do nothing for a round, regain 1 AP from the trash (if you have lost any).

### "Beginning of the Round"

Sometimes the *particular* order things happen in the "beginning of the round" will matter. In that case, they resolve in this order.
 
#### 1. Effect Managment

Any *already active* effects that trigger "at the beginning of a round" happen first. They happen before anything else in the round does. Examples includes taking damage from \[poison] or \[bleed] or gaining health from \[heal]. If you have an effect active that causes you to do some sort of roll or contest, do that now.

#### 2. Status Management

Statuses are added or removed now. A point of \[poison] is removed, a point of \[heal] is removed, anything that would end at the "beginning" of this round ends *now*.

### 3. Skills

Some moves and skills can be used "at the beginning of the round". These must be used **after** effects and statuses resolve.
