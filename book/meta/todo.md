I'll admit I'm not 100% on this: change score increases from costing 1 SP to 100 SP, change skill costs accordingly. Skill pricing guide?

Make an extended about section, write about how the game is meant to play, the emphasis on exploration and improvisation, write about how one *should* be able to GM the game.

Probably around that area, mention how most fights should probably not be to the death.
