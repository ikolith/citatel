title: The End of the World
---

As you head east you approach the End of the World. You climb gentle hills that drop down to valleys only to climb again up to higher plateaus. As you near the End, the climbs and descents both become steeper but every peak is higher than the last. The geographical features become like nested moats and taluses guarding the End. The End itself is more like a sheer wall of stone than a mountain range, there is no peak visible. The layers of stone extend up into the sky and away forever.  

You reach the End. You stand in the highlands at its foot with your back to it. You look back at the infinite horizon formed by the sky and the land below you. You then turn around to face the End again and look straight up to see another infinite horizon. This horizon is the line between the rock formations and hanging forests of the End and the sky, with mists and clouds dancing between them. 

This journey is long, dangerous, and expensive. It means going right up to the limit of the known world. To go past this point, to go into the End itself is for the suicidally greedy, the desperate, religious zealots, and the insane.

## The End in Culture

The End is always visible reaching into the sky to the east. It becomes a backdrop, forgotten in day-to-day life by the people below who have to attend to lower things. It is the setting of legends and stories. Religions teach that their Gods live here in this world but just past the End, or that one passes through the End only on death, or that the End is the end of everything, and there can be nothing past it.

## On the Efforts of the Suicidally Greedy, the Desperate, the Religious Zealot, and the Insane

Abutting the end are lawless highlands, ruins, and small towns that survive by catering to travelers journeying to the end. 

In some places the End hangs over the land, creating permanent twilight and shadow.
Sailors find what seem passageways into the end. Passageways in which the ocean is gradually restricted to a winding river with towering rock on either side, the sky all clouds. The boundary between the ocean and the End is full of these passageways, though none have ever been confirmed to go through the End. Some pilgrims have attempted to climb the End, others go through the vast cave networks in the End.

Expeditions to the End rarely return, but when they do they bear strange artifacts and conflicting stories of terrible and incredible creatures as well as entire civilizations. The End a temptation for the powerful and a focal point of conspiracies.
