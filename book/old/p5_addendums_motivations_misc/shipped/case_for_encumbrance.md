title:  A Case for Encumbrance, Rations, etc.
---

Logistical rules for encumbrance, rations, etc have a bad reputation. Often they feel like meaningless and slow bookkeeping. These rules are meant to be light enough that they should not slow the game down, but I want quickly go over why these rules are worth having in the first place.

These rules force players to make decisions about what they're going to take with them and what they're going to prepare for. Players and NPCs are very close to one another in HP and damage output in this game. The way you get an edge on someone else in combat is figuring out what your best option is given what you've prepared and the resources you have. The strength of most items and abilities are contextual, but this won't matter or make the game more interesting if you can carry around a tool for every context.

Encumbrance rules also add depth outside of combat. When trading with someone on the road, you have to trade with something you brought. If you're delivering something to someone or hiding something, you have to keep it somewhere. These logistical questions should cause you to engage with the world like it's a real place and make decisions about what you want to take with you and what you want to leave, what is important to your character and why. If your character is a rugged outlander that knows how to survive in the wilderness you have an important role in the party, you're the reason the party is able to pack light and travel quickly, you're the reason that the party can survive when you all run out of rations. There are many more opportunities for non-combat character decisions to be important.

All of this allows different weapons, items, and characters to shine in different contexts. This encourages different people in the party to take up different roles, acquire specialized  skills, and adapt to the specific situations they find themselves in.
