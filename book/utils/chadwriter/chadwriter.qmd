<style>#title-block-header{display: none} /* Hides qmd title, since the included html already has a title. */ h1{margin-top: 0} /* Removes margin the site's css would otherwise place at the top of the  included page's first h1, ie it would make the included title offset in a garish way.*/</style>
<!-- This method for including the html is not strictly necessary, because you could rename the html page to be a qmd (qmd is a superset of md and md is by fiat a superset of html!), but doing it this way lets us have proper title metadata, which displays nicely in search. Although, oddly, it will FAIL to work if this comment is on the same line as it! Anyhow, here it is:-->
{{< include index.html >}}
