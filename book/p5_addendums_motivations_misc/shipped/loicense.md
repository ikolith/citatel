No [funging](https://probablynotfungible.ignatius.coffee/)!

I have not chosen a license. Here I will describe ~~what I want out of a license.~~ how I feel about such things. To quickly get this out of the way, there's no way I'm picking OGL, fuck that trash fire. It'll probably be some Creative Commons or Copyleft nonsense.

I'm tired of seeing cool databases, tooling, or projects limited by copyright. I'm tired of DRM, licenses, censure, "platforms", "live service", subscriptions, and paywalls. Why do we need this in TTRPGs? It seems to me that this medium especially would benefit from being open and collaborative, allowing for works to be transferred, shared, altered, transformed, etc with no strings attached. Not only should this be "allowed" it should be encouraged and supported! Rather than paying lip service to this idea and then only presenting the data in a shitty pdf, just distribute the source so people don't have to sit around copying and scraping! You have the data! If you want people to engage with it, just *give them the data already!*

I understand this is easier said than done. One major purpose of this project is to present a proof of concept, it is to show that one *could* use the technology we have now to enable greater collaboration, sharing, and even make creating books themselves easier.

I like physical TTRPG books. I own way too many. I buy them from creators I like despite the current state-of-the-industry, not because of it. I want to write and print a book without middlemen and publishers, I want it to be available online for anyone. I want the work I put in making this possible to help other people do the same.

If, when this is a book, you want to engage with the work as a whole the way it was intended, then you will be free to buy the book. If you don't want to buy it for some reason, *whatever reason*, just print it at some library, read it on your computer or phone, whatever! You already know I need money to get food to eat. Supporting things you like to the degree that you can is a solved problem, there's nothing else to say! You already know what to do!

If you just want a big stack of swords for your own much cooler setting, godspeed! If you want to create some encounter generator for your own setting and want to grab a couple monsters, download the files, repurpose my code, make something cool, don't ask me before you do it! And for the love of god share it so other people can do the same.

Obviously I want to be able to point to "ah, this is my setting, it's the one I made, this is the stuff that is canonically in it". Of course people should be able to do that. Does copyright help here? I'm not convinced. It seems, in fact, to mostly hurt people that actually make things. Is this what a trademark is for? I don't know. Are these questions immiserating? Yes. Is this why I started doing this stuff? No. Am I tired of writing this? Yes.
