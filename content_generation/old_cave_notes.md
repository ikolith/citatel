# Intro

There are basically two types of basic cave feature, "passages" and "rooms". Either can be a natural result of geological processes or something constructed.  
A mining tunnel would be a "passage", and so would a narrow tunnel. A massive empty underground aquifer counts as a "room", as would the small den of a creature.  

## How do Rooms and Passages Interact?
Passages always attach one room to one other room. Rooms can attach to multiple passages. A fork in a passage is just a very small room with multiple passages attached to it. Rooms are nodes that can be connected to an arbitrary number of passages, but passages are connections that can only ever attach one room to one other room.
Rooms tend to exist on one level, most level change will come from passages.

# Rooms and Passages, Flavorful Detail

## Rooms and their Qualities
- Size/Dimensions: Huge variety here, from the special room type of the "fork" which is just a container for passages, to entire biomes... This should probably just be expressed through a restrained set of size categories?

### Rooms: Geographical Features  
Cave stuff, ya dig?
- Huge hole in the ground, openings in the ground, could be Passages techincally, passages in the ground. Really, all entrances of passages can be considered geographical features of the room.
- Ledge protruding from the wall, either as overhang or as terrace.
- Stalagmites, Stalagtites, probably both exist or neither do, probably indicate that water was here or continues to be here, possibly water drips from the stalagmites, suggesting water is near
- Bodies of water. Underground rivers, falls, ponds, springs.

### Rooms: Types, Places
- Jugles, Salt Jungles
- Marshes, Salt Marshes
- Hanging glowing lichen networks on the ceiling.

### Rooms: Events
Events: Alternatively, "Encounters". This is where most content will be generated and includes things like treasure chests.
- Sets of enemies, ranked by difficulty, their current activity selected from a table based on a roll.
- The mists traveling through the caves, and their own varied contents.

## Qualities of Passages
- Length: Not clear whether this should be expressed in travel time as determined by the sort of passage it is, or whether this should just be distance.
- Diameter/Quality: Whether the passage is a wide tunnel or a crack that must be crawled through. This effects travel time.)
- Encounters, specifically "Passing Encounters": These are encounters that involve other traveling characters or characters that are waiting in the passage for some specific purpose, like ambush, commerce, both of which could probably be more easily done in a room.
- Change in Level: The difference in depth between one end of the passage and the other.
- Geographical events contained within traveling the passage. Most commonly a vertical section, "chimney". Salt deposits.

# Actually Generating the Things
Lol. Getting to that. First going to use the Veins of the Earth generator for a while. Maybe I will automate it, to get a skeleton of what that sort of thing would be like.
Though I really do want to stick to theme of adjacent structures probabalistically interacting.

# Special Subtypes
- The Great Labyrinths, abandoned, of unknown utility.
- Mechanical Temple Ruins (See also, the sundial that will likely be found before this)
- The Library Mind
- The Tomb-Hives
- Great tracks left by something huge.

## Notes on Enemies and Beings
Spine covered giant eels that attempt to encircle and close around the whole group.
Beings that exist in and move through the veins of rock.
Slime creatures that create large mucosal traps that they move around in and attack you from.
Similar mucosal enemies that cause slashing weapons, maybe bludgeoning, to get stuck?
Brain-eating mist creatures that hunt you?
The giant mostly flightless roof climbing cave bats.
The tower crab, that tall deep sea crab.
The underground salt-waste aquifer with stalagtite(mite?) islands.
Soft rock, more like clay than rock, grazed on by giant cave bovine creatures.
Legion-like fungus things, honestly just add legions.
Ruins of underground city.
