The cards say “1 AP” and indicate what character they belong to.\nWhen initiative starts all characters pass their table sets to the DM. The DM shuffles them together. The DM pulls a card from the top of the deck and deals the card to the character/player that it belongs to. When a character is dealt a card they can choose to act, spending however many cards they want to. They can also just hold on to the card.

They are: [B] for “Bludgeoning”, [P] for “Piercing” and [S] for “Slashing”. There are also sub-types like [Severing], [Slicing], and [Picking]. [Severing] counts as the more generic [S], but [S] does not count as [Severing]. The damage sub-type will share the first letter of the more generic damage type. This has worked so far because there are very many words in english and they are conveniently placed. I am not afraid to resort to attic greek or something to keep this stupid system working.\nSome weapons do two types of damage only for the purposes of armor damage reduction, only the first gets to be used for skills (that’s bad). This looks like: [B]/[P]\n\nSome common damage subtypes:\n[Slicing]: What a saber does. Long fast drawing cut, often with a curved blade.\n[Severing]: What an axe does. Chop chop.\n[Picking]: What a warpick does.\n\n\nUnused damage types:\n[Bashing]: Not sure what sort of blunt weapon would blunt in a way that is different enough to justify this damage type, but it is there.\n[Pickling]: What a warpickle does.\n\n\nDon’t\n[Striking]: Don’t do this.\n[Stabbing]: Please don’t do.\n\n\n\n\nWeapon Damage\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F0dQgrzN-6pcHPDZExC7pSu5xIdd3tqt3Z-oVc8CK0g/edit?pli=1#gid=437119287\n\n\nWeapon Switching\nDropping a weapon is a free action. Putting a second hand on a one-handed weapon is a free action, same for removing a hand from a weapon or any such minor adjustment, if in doubt TTYGM. Drawing a weapon costs 1 AP. Picking a weapon up off the ground costs 1 AP and you’re [vulnerable] while you’re doing it, you can be interrupted with an attack while you duck down to grab a weapon. Putting a weapon away costs 1 AP.\n\n\nBeing Below a Weapon’s Requirements\nIf you’re below a weapon’s requirements, you get no score based damage scaling (+SCORE) when using that weapon. Your max + To-Hit is 0 with that weapon. For every point you are below a SCORE requirement halve the damage you do rounding up. If you would do 1 damage you cannot wield the weapon.\n\n\nTwo-handing a [one-handed] weapon, one-handing a [two-handed] weapon\nIf you’re 2 STR above the requirements for a [two-handed] weapon, you can effectively wield it with one hand. If you use two hands on a [one-handed] weapon, raise your effective STR with the weapon by 2.\n\n\nThrowing a spear or a dagger without a specific [thrown] move\nFor every point you are below requirements for the weapon, halve the range. Throwing a spear or dagger costs 2 AP, uses PER(CEPTION) to hit, has no damage scaling, 3 + AGI spaces for range. It does half damage rounded up when thrown."

    "text": "Injury and Death\nThis part consistently needs reworking.\n\nInjury\nInjuries are unique conditions that typically come with crit damage. Injuries are removed when the character reaches full crit health.\n\n\nDying Instantly or Being Stabilized\nIf you are reduced to -(Max HP/2) you die instantly.\nIf your HP is brought above 0, you are stabilized. If you are stabilized but you haven’t reached 6 HP, rest (rolling recovery dice) until you reach 6 HP. If you’re brought back to 6 HP or more, regain consciousness.\n\nBeing Reduced to 0 HP, Being “Downed”\nYou can have negative HP. You can also stabilize even with negative HP, but you have to reach 6 HP before you regain consciousness.\nWhen a player is reduced to 0 but not killed, they are “down” and they are unconscious. If they are not stabilized, they are unable to take any sort of action besides rolling death checks. They are [vulnerable].\nWhen a player is downed the DM sets a death DC by rolling 2d6 with no modifiers. The DM does not tell the player the DC.\nOn the turn a player is downed and on every subsequent turn, the player rolls a death check and tells the DM their roll. If their roll matches or passes the DC it’s a success. If the roll is below the DC, it’s a failure. If the roll is a failure, the DM notes by how much the roll failed, DC - roll. This difference will be used to determine the consequence of the failure using the consequence table. Don’t make any extra rolls to resolve consequences at this point as other characters might use medicine to improve the outcome, skills might be triggered, etc. Consequences are only resolved if/when the character survives.\n3 successes means the character stabilizes at their current HP. 3 failures means they die.\nOnce they either hit 3 successes or 3 failures, the DM tells them to stop rolling. They are not told whether they died or not or what consequences they might have. They only find out once someone goes to check on their character.\nIf you’re hit while you’re down, take the damage and add a failed death check.\n\n\n\nConsequence Tables\nConsequence tables exist to determine what happens if you fail death checks. Different areas might have different consequence tables, the DM might pick a table completely randomly. Different campaigns might prefer harsher or more lenient consequenes. Having many consequence tables and an unknown death DC should make being downed stressful and full of uncertainty, this can increase the stakes while not necessarily increasing the chance that the character dies.

    "section": "Encumbrance and Rations",
    "text": "Encumbrance and Rations\nEncumbrance is measured in encs. Encs are a combined measure of weight and unwieldiness. Most weapons are 1 enc. A [heavy] weapon is 2 encs. A days worth of food and water is 1. 3 small items, like a book, a dagger, and some bandages together take 1 enc. Negligible items like quills and needles don’t take up any encs, unless the DM determines you are carrying “way too many”.\nPlayers must describe and account for how they are moving their things. They take “reasonable” penalties for impractical methods. If they tie a bunch of swords together and then hang that off of their neck, they will have a hard time stealthing. If they fall over while wearing the described necklace of dangerous wind chimes they’re going to have a bad time.\n\nStorage Spaces, The “Personal” Space and Bags\n“Storage space” is used to broadly refer to any place you can put things. Each storage space you have can be thought of as a source of a max encumbrance and a source of an [encumbered] threshold. Most of the time you will have two storage spaces:\n\nYour “personal” space, which includes anything you’re carrying that isn’t itself a storage space. Most often this would be your weapons and armor.\nYour bag. This is most often some kind of backpack.\n\nYou have a personal [encumbered] threshold. This is used for the weapons and armor you are carrying without a bag. Your personal [encumbered] threshold is 3 + STR. Your personal max encumbrance is 6 + STR encs.\nThe primary use of a bag is to give you more [encumbered] thresholds and to change your maximum encumbrance.\nBags have varying [encumbered] thresholds and max encumbrances. If a bag does not say it has an [encumbrance] threshold, then it never makes you [encumbered]. This is common for small bags that don’t have a max encumbrance high enough to be able to encumber, or bags that are designed not to encumber.\nRemoving a bag is 2 AP.\nSearching a bag is 2 AP.\n\n\nThe [encumbered] Threshold and Maximum Encumbrance\nIf you are past any encumbrance threshold in any storage space, you are [encumbered], you have the [encumbered] status.\nThe [encumbered] status lowers your move speed by 1. Your Defense is lowered by 3. Additionally, take a -1 to all AGI checks.\nIf you aren’t wearing heavy armor but you’re carrying enough in your bag to pass the bag’s encumbrance threshold, you are [encumbered]. Less obviously, this also means that if you are past your personal encumbrance threshold (most likely from carrying weapons and wearing armor that are too heavy for you to move freely with) but you are not past your [encumbered] threshold for your bag, you are still [encumbered].\nIn order to avoid passing an [encumbered] threshold you likely want to spread the weight around multiple storage spaces, keeping under all of their [encumbered] thresholds, or you might want to just put everything in a bag so that in a fight you can take it off quickly and not be [encumbered].\nYou cannot carry more encs in total than your single highest max encumbrance score. This does not mean that having one storage space where you can carry 8 encs means that you must be able to carry 8 encs in every storage space, it just means that all together you can’t carry more than 8 encs.\nUnless otherwise specified, you can only use one bag at a time. If some mechanic allows you to use multiple bags, you cannot carry in total more than your highest max encumbrance from a single source, though you can move encs around to try to avoid the [encumbered] status effect.\nYour [encumbered] threshold and your maximum encumbrance can be affected by status effects or skills, but most often they will be affected by the bag you are using."

    "section": "SOCIAL Rolls",
    "text": "SOCIAL Rolls\nThis system is designed to allow a characters skills and stats to augment their social actions. The emphasis is not on getting good rolls, but on saying or doing the right thing. Rolls are used to express a particular character’s social talents, but they don’t replace what a character says or does. Grading numerical difficulty for a social interaction is difficult. A GM cannot prepare beforehand for the things a player will do or say, so DCs have to be set on the fly. Sometimes they are set incorrectly or something breaks. In this case, ignore the system/roll and do whatever is the most sensible/interesting/funny. This framework is largely for the benefit of the GM, to allow them to easily keep track of attitudes and relationships and to quickly create DCs and resolve rolls in a way that rewards the skill of the player as well as the skill of the character.\nSocial skills are divided into two sets: communicative skills and perceptive skills. communicative skills include persuasion, deception, and performance. Perceptive skills include sensing motives, detecting deceit, and gaining insight into another character’s emotional state.\n\nCommunicative Skills, Bias, and Reputation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n6\nRevered\nYou are seen as almost otherwordly, beyond reproach.\n\n\n5\nLoved\nYou are set apart from others, distinctly trustworthy, valued, and important.\n\n\n4\nAdmired\nYou are seen as an example to be followed, people will give your words great weight. They will go out of their way to help you out.\n\n\n3\nTrusted\nYou are trusted and valued. People will go out of their way to help you.\n\n\n2\nWell-Liked\nYou are liked quite a bit. People are willing to help you out. They want to see you do well.\n\n\n1\nLiked\nYou are liked. People want to talk and barter.\n\n\n0\nNeutral\nPeople don’t think much of you one way or another. They have the time to talk.\n\n\n-1\nDisliked\nPeople will give you bad deals in trade. They do not particularly want to talk to you. They do not want to barter.\n\n\n-2\nStrongly Disliked\nPeople do not want to talk or trade. They want you to go away.\n\n\n-3\nLoathed\nYou are a pariah. A group might throw you in jail, an individual might do you harm opportunistically. People will actively try to get rid of you.\n\n\n-4\nHated\nYou will be attacked. If someone is attacking you, they will be given help.\n\n\n-5\nDespised\nYou will be attacked on sight. There is probably a bounty on your head.\n\n\n-6\nReviled\nYou are vilified and reviled. Your name, face, and terrible actions are known. A group will send paid assassins and soldiers after you. An individual will go to great lengths and take on great risk and personal cost in order to do as much harm as possible to you.\n\n\n\nThe framework for setting a DC for a given social roll can also be used as a framework for managing a character’s reputation among different groups. The scores range from -6 (“Reviled”) to +6 (“Revered”). These scores can be used by a GM to easily keep track of relationships and attitudes. They are also mechanical modifiers. If a character is at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”) with some group or individual, subtract 2 from their social check and/or their passive social score.\nYou can use these scores to set a sort of “default” attitude or bias for NPCs. The kindly innkeeper in a small peaceful town might treat every new person at around +2 (“Well-Liked”). The sneering guards in front of a keep might treat everyone at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”). Another traveler on the road just trying to get to where they’re going might be at -1 (“Disliked”) just because they really don’t want to stop and chat. The same traveler might, if you help them out, switch to +1 (“Liked”).\nIf a player passes the DC, treat their interaction as happening at 1 point higher than it would be otherwise. If the player exceeds the DC by more than 3, treat the interaction as +2.\nAn example: a player character is in a town in which they are at -3 (“Loathed”). Typically, this would mean that they are treated as a pariah, people are unwilling to talk to them and will actively attempt to get rid of them. They might be thrown in jail on made up charges. If they are very charismatic they may be able to walk into a shop, attempt to talk the owner into selling them something and recieve a +2 for the interaction. The shop owner might think that the player character doesn’t seem quite as bad as people say, maybe he thinks that he is misremembering something or getting the player character confused with someone else. He is still wary, however. He still treats the character as -1 or “Disliked”, he will tend not to want to barter. He’ll want to get through the interaction quickly. Similarly, a guard treating everyone at -2 might be persuaded to relax a bit and just talk to the player character on neutral terms (-2 -&gt; 0).\nRemember that the good will from one positive social interaction does not last forever. Actions will tend to have a greater effect than words. If you just stabbed someone, you are not going to be able to smooth that over with your wit and charm.\nThe table with specific characterizations is useful, but it can be boiled down to some rules of thumb. 0 is neutral. From +1 to +3 the character is favored. Persuasion, information gathering, and bartering will be easier. People give you the benefit of the doubt. From +3 to +6 people will go out of their way to help you, they will likely come to your aid in combat or follow you into combat. From -1 to -3 people dislike you and generally do not want to have anything to do with you. -4 to -6 is when you start seeing a lot of unprovoked violence.\nThere are several different ways a GM can deal with this system in game. The system can be player-facing. You could tell your players their numerical reputation among different groups or numerical values for the attitudes of various characters. A DM could gate numerical information behind something like a good insight roll. A DM can also keep the entire system completely to themsleves, as a tool for the to structure descriptions and interactions.\n\n\nSocial Perception\n“Social perception” is used here to refer to skills that allow you to roll to sense motives, detect deceit, and gain insight into another character’s emotional state. When a player asks a question that would fall under “social perception” about another character, they should first be given a superficial description of the character and their apparent emotional state. If the character in question seems to be at ease, the GM should just say so. This is true even if the character in question is only pretending to be at ease, but plans to attack or betray the player’s character. The rules and skills for social perception are not meant to cover the superficial. These rules are for attempts to read another character. Social perception rolls are very similar to other character conflicts, they can be either a check or a contest.\n\n\nSocial Checks\nWhen the roll is a check, the DC will be the usual passive DC, 6 + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills, bias, reputation). If you are trying to read a character who is is lying the DC will be set by their initial attempt to lie, which will have been a check + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills) against your passive social perception. If they attempt to lie and fail this check, then whatever they said will be described as highly suspicious. If they succeed in their initial check, but you pass their DC when you attempt to read them, you will notice that something seems wrong, you might notice inconsistencies in what they said, they might seem nervous or suspicious.\nSocial perception rolls are almost always checks. If you are lying to someone, you perform a check. If they are trying to figure out if you are lying, they perform a check. If someone is trying to convince you of something and you think they might be lying, you perform a check.\n\nSocial Check Resolution\nIn the case of a tie, resolution is the same as any other check. Defender wins. Otherwise there are four possible outcomes.\nIf you pass the check more than 3, Complete Success:\nYou read the defender like an open book. You get a full answer to whatever question you were asking, or as full an answer as you could get from watching someone. They crumble at your gaze. Maybe they are so caught off guard that they mention something they should not have.\nIf you pass the check by 3 or less, Moderate Success:\nYou get some insight into the question you were asking. If you are trying to see if someone is lying, you’ll know that they’re not telling the whole truth, that they are actively misleading you. If you’re trying to get insight into someone’s emotional state, you get a good idea of how they are feeling. You might be able to tell that someone is distressed and trying to hide it. This is a pretty good read of someone. They do not know that you know anything.\nIf you fail the check by 3 or less, Moderate Failure:\nYou have no answer to your question at all and the person you were attempting to read knows what you were doing. If you were trying to figure out if someone was lying about a specific claim, they know that you don’t trust them or that you suspect them in some way. Otherwise, you might just be staring and it’s weird.\nIf you fail the check by more than 3, Catastrophic Failure:\nGod have mercy on your soul. You completely give yourself away, your interests and your question are written all over your face. If you are trying to catch a lie, not only is it clear what exactly you think is being lied about, it’s clear that you have no idea if the defender is lying. Maybe you scoffed at a specific claim, maybe you blurt out some crucial piece of information at exactly the wrong time. Your face is very red.\n\n\n\nContests\nContests are far rarer than checks. Social perception contests happen in contexts where it is understood that both parties are trying to advance their own interests. Some examples of this would be a tense negotiation, an official dinner of ambassadors whose states are on the brink of war, a game of poker, spies meeting to trade secrets while not revealing their true interests. In these cases checks would be happening simultaneously anyway, and the information that someone might doubt what you are saying or that they might not be telling the whole truth wouldn’t be very meaningful.\nContest Resolution is just about the same as check resolution. The difference between the rolls of the two characters determines which character succeeds and which fails, and to what degree. This success and failure are captured by the same event. For example one character might give away information they shouldn’t have, which captures both the success of one character and the failure of another.\nTies are just ties, a staredown, a tense silence. If your group prefers, ties can be resolved in the normal way for a contest: win goes to the higher modifier, if that’s a tie, it’s a tie in game. If that outcome makes no sense, roll again."

    "text": "HYLIC and SALT\n“Salt” comes in two forms. The first is the alchemically active SALT found deep in the earth or in the End (this is used as a magical resource, so to avoid confusion it’s written in all caps, “SALT”). The second is any adulterated form of the first, including the sort of salt used in cooking. Alchemical SALT can be transformed into a much larger amount of conventional salt, or it might be used to fuel some spell. SALT is the most common currency in the End and especially underground. SALT is measured in “flakes” denoted “f”. 1 full unit of SALT used in casting is equivalent in mass to 100f. SALT when ingested and used as a casting resource is like [poison] or [bleed], it’s a status effect tracked by tokens. Sometimes this is notated as [SALT]. [SALT] naturally wears off at the rate of 1 [SALT] per hour. Having [SALT] equal to or greater than 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn causes you to take 20 damage.\n\nCasting, but Salty\nThere are two common ways to use [SALT], “burning” over a long period, typically an hour, and “flaring”, or spending a lot of [SALT] in a short period for a larger effect. Flaring lasts anywhere from a single move to several hours depending on the ability. Burning and flaring both cost about 1-3 [SALT], typically. Anyone can learn to burn [SALT] though doing so is dangerous.\n\nSALT/HYLIC Casting Rules\n\nIf your [SALT] is above 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn, take 6 damage and lose 1 [SALT].\nThe total amount of [SALT] you are burning and flaring at any one time cannot exceed your HYLIC score (though your [SALT] itself can exceed your HYLIC).\nWhile you are burning [SALT] for an ability, that [SALT] still counts towards your total [SALT]. If you choose to shut off an ability before it would naturally go away, the ability ends, but the [SALT] still has to go away naturally."
