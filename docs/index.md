This is the public home of "tactile".

This is unfinished. Most of the content that actually exists isn't here yet, and even if it was, a lot would still have to be done. All of the [code](./_pages/code_and_downloads/code.md) *is* here. 

This still needs to be play-tested extensively. I try to run games sometimes. If you want to be involved contact me on github or message me on discord. Any contributions, input, or involvement is welcome. 

## If You're New Around Here

[About](./_pages/about.md) will give you more info on the website, what type of game this is, the setting, etc.

After that you probably want to read the [Rules](./_pages/rules_and_resources/rules.md).

Most of the rest of the content lives in the sidebar, including guides to create [weapons](./pages/../_pages/rules_and_resources/weapon_creation.md) and [NPCs](./_pages/rules_and_resources/npc_creation.md), currently existing [NPCs and factions](./_pages/talaje/npcs_and_factions.md) and general setting [lore](./_pages/talaje/lore.md)

If you have an interest in linguistics, check out the [Language](./pages/talaje/../../_pages/talaje/language/language.md) section.
