I've decided to change my workflow, using Quarto to more easily create something that can be read and printed as a book. This site won't get many more updates, if any, until it is replaced by the new site.

## If You're New Around Here

[About](./_pages/about.md) will give you more info on the website, what type of game this is, the setting, etc.

After that you probably want to read the [Rules](./_pages/rules_and_resources/rules.md).

Most of the rest of the content lives in the sidebar, including guides to create [weapons](./pages/../_pages/rules_and_resources/weapon_creation.md) and [NPCs](./_pages/rules_and_resources/npc_creation.md), currently existing [NPCs and factions](./_pages/talaje/npcs_and_factions.md) and general setting [lore](./_pages/talaje/lore.md)

If you have an interest in linguistics, check out the [Language](./pages/talaje/../../_pages/talaje/language/language.md) section.

[Posts](./_pages/posts.md) are miscellaneous notes, ideas, or observations about the game.
