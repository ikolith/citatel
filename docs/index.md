This is the public home of "tactile", the system what is probably going to end up with a different name.

If you got this link, please refrain from sharing it. I'm not willing to pay for Github Plus or whatever to make this private.

Most everything related to this system lives in another very messy private repo along with a good deal of code. There are google docs and long rambling discord messages about what this game is and what it is trying to achieve scattered in the wind. I am working on bringing all of that together in this repo. Things will be added regularly. Hopefully. Unless I need to go with some other site generator.

By the end of this, all of the work done on the game should end up happening in this repo. New content should go directly into this site.

I do not like working in a public repo. However, the whole idea was that this would be available for anyone to use, change, etc. so it's just an L I have to take.

I welcome quetsions and suggestions. @ me on the server. If you're not on the server how did you get here my guy?
