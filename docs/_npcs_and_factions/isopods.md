## Culture

The Isopods are an ancient people with courts, politics, philosophy, and dynasties. They can communicate through writing and speech. They can bypass language entirely to communicate complex feelings and even full thoughts directly to one another via pheremones. They do this instinctively, like a person moves their face.  

The Isopod word for what we would call thought is approximately "inner thought" where pheremones are "outer thought". Their word for themselves is approximately "thinker", whereas their words for other groups relate the members of those groups to objects.  

In the ornate and ancient Isopod courts, richly painted Isopods attempt to subtly manipulate each other by precisely deploying pheremones, even using bottled pheremones to mislead and persuade. They might strategically steer the mood of a room through highly trained covert manipulators, though an Isopod gentleman would never admit this.  

Isopods view life in the caves as beautiful, ancient, and harmonious. In the caves their pheromones are not tossed to the wind as on the surface. It seems natural and just, then, that the underground should be so vast and varied where the surface is merely the end of useful space. They believe the world must be a sphere, as a sphere would maximize underground volume while minimizing surface area. They find it tremendously convenient that when a form of life is meant to be eaten, they generally have their hard structure on the inside, which could only serve the purpose of making them more suitable as food. They tend see their ability to speak to lower life as a great convenience, like being able to order around your coat rack. They are not a religous group generally, so a question their philosophers must grapple with is "Why, if there is no God, is the world so just?"  
Isopods also have philosophy on the nature of being and conciousness. They hold that, because they can directly communicate and transfer thoughts and emotions, they can verify and understand the experience and the conciousness of other Isopods. Groups that do not have this ability cannot meaningfully be said to be conscious. Most isopods think of mammals and similar as a sort of automata, not capable of any true thought or complex socialization. They are not generally hostile or even rude to mammals. To mistreat a lower life form would not be immoral per se, but it would be tremendously gauche. If you tell an Isopod your name, say "Tod" and it has reason to remember your name, it may refer to you as "It Calls Itself Tod", though this is typically shortened to "itsa Tod".  

Isopods once ruled the earth and they believe their time will come again. They are one of the oldest forms of life, persisting largely unchanged through time.  
They have mixed views on other bugs, depending on their ability to communicate.  

Their gathering places and halls are all three dimensional, with structures along the whole surface of the cave. Isopods converse in great halls along the ceiling and on the walls as well as on the floor.  

They absolutely revile the ants and would see them exterminated. They read what primitive "pheremones" the ants create as a sort of repugnant malignancy below the level of thought. Their hate and fear is magnified by the growing numbers of the ants.

## Isopod Anatomy, Movement, Fighting

Isopods have thick layered bands of chitin along their top side, this forms their natural armor. They have seven pairs of jointed appendages. Each appendage ends in two articulated long sticky fingers. The two front pairs of appendages are the longest, with long fingers meant for fine manipulation. Lacking thumbs, the Isopods use their arms in vertical pairs, with the two suspended top fingers and two suspended bottom fingers working in tandem, each finger opposable. The appendages after the foremost pairs become shorter and their main purpose shifts from manipulation to movement. They move low, using all of the limbs that line their body. They move parallel to the ground, with the bulk of their limbs folded under them. Isopods are larger than humans, though of course they are shorter when walking. They do not call their movement "crawling".

They will tip their front portions upward in only a couple of situations. The first is when engaged in some especially demanding manual task where lifting something in front of themselves using only a couple of limb pairs will not suffice, as in the use of most of their instruments. The second is as a posture of deference or trust. 

They fight primarily through quickly throwing out rope darts or barbed blades with their long powerful fore-limbs and then either retracting the projectiles or attaching the ropes to the surfaces of the cave, suspending their victim from multiple points. They do this while moving rapidly along the cave walls. They employ long specialized patas and katars in close combat. They also use nets to slow down their enemies.
