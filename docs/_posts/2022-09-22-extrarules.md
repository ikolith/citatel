## Increasing Scores

If you want to know how much it costs to go from 0 to any number where the number is x, use this equation: (x(x+1))/2. You can also just use summation notation (Σn). 

## Some Basic Statistics for Making Your Own Randomized Character Creation Rolls 

If you want to know how I got these numbers and how you might make your own randomization scheme, read the next section. Else, skip it.

At a glance it might seem like d6-3 and d4-2 should be equally good. The expected value of a d6 is 3.5, so 3.5 - 3 = 0.5. EV of a d4 is 2.5, 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 as well, so why is d6-3 twice as good as d4-2?
Getting to 2 in a score costs 3 SP (1 + 2), but getting to 3 costs 6 SP (1 + 2 + 3). Crucially, raising your score from a negative number always costs 1 SP, so if you roll a 1 on d6-3, you end up with -2, which is only equivalent to getting -2 SP (that is, you only have to spend 2 more SP than if you never bothered rolling at all) but if you roll a 6, you get a score of 3 which is worth 6 SP. High rolls are a lot more rewarding than low rolls are punishing at character creation.

If you want to figure out your own randomization schemes (that involve a single die) and what their equivalent average SP value is, doing so is relatively simple. First, you figure out all of the possible rolls. For d6-3, these rolls are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 (a roll of 1 - 3 = -2, etc.). Then find the "values" or SP you would have to spend to get that score for the rolls. For d6-3 these are -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 6. To get the average value, just add up all the SP values and divide by the number of rolls (because all of the rolls will be equally likely). In the case of d6-3, you get 1.5. Finally, multiply the per-roll-SP-value you just found by the number of scores you're rolling for to see the equivalent SP.  

Remember that randomization means PCs will end up with characters whose scores are "worth" different amounts of SP.

Finally, consider giving players some points specifically to buy skills with. Or don't!

## Initiative Rules A: Static Standard

### When you take your turn.

You do not roll for initiative when combat starts. Initiative order is determined by how much AGI you have. 
If multiple characters on the same side have the same AGI, they choose among themselves who goes first. If there is a tie, then the side with the most characters goes first. If that is a tie, roll an AGI contest.

### When things happen in your turn.

First, effects that take place “at the beginning of your next turn” take place, this includes damage from poison, health from healing, spell effects, etc. Then, tokens, effects, AP, numbers, are all lowered by 1. AP that was on square 2 of the tracker goes to 1, 1 to 0. You lose 1 stack of poison, 1 stack of healing, etc. Finally, you can take your turn. 

**If you're using the optional interrupt rules:** Ending your turn means the next person in initiative goes, but if you have the AP you can always still try to use a move with [interrupt]. Remember, if your turn has passed, the interrupt attempt doesn’t cost AP, but you still have to have a contest with whoever you’re trying to interrupt if they don't want you to interrupt them, for example, all enemies. 

## Too Much Snark for the Case for Encumbrance

In the fantasy books we read the hero sets off on his horse in the night with a hastily thrown together pack containing some clothes, some cheese, meat, bread, and his father's sword hidden under his cloak. He meets many strange people and ends up in dangerous situations. He doesn't stop by Wal-Generalstore for his Standard Adventurer's Pack, get stopped by a ravine with a shack next to it, and go "well, I woulda taken the one with the grappling hook" and then take 20 to "grapple hook across" the ravine.  

You're a looney tunes character in a world of people who are supposed to intrigue you or pose a threat to you but don't get to carry a STRV-103 for three months because they "forget they had it".


## Skill Points and Character Advancement or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Play Calvinball

There is no XP, there is no structured way to gain skill points, skill points are awarded by the DM for solving problems, winning combat encounters, etc. Skill points can, are often, earmarked for something relevant to what you were doing. So, if you’re a STR based warrior who has been fighting for the last couple hours, you might get SP earmarked for that, rather than SP that can be used to improve your persuasion. If you want to improve your persuasion, work at it somehow. Persuade some folks. TTYDM. Character advancement is admittedly calvinball right now.

Additionally, increasing attributes is probably too cheap and skills are probably too expensive.

### Bits

Atl-atls can only be used with [one-handed] spears. Using an atl-atl requires 1 STR, 1 DEX and adds 3 to the spear’s thrown range and +AGI to damage.
