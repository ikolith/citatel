It's a setting. It's the only setting for this system at the moment. Several people including myself work on it.  
It is not what the entire system is built around, the idea, the hope, is that the system should be modular enough that you can borrow whatever you want from whatever setting.

You'll notice most of it seems to take place in an underground setting, this is for two reasons. The first,is that testing was/is going to mostly take place inside of the End, with players climbing through the tunnels of the End, either up or down. The second is because Veins of the Earth is what got me to actually take a shot at creating this whole thing. I revisit it regularly when I feel burnt out to remind myself that this medium can do some crazy shit. You can tell because everything I've written reads like bad Veins fanfiction. 

I'll add more concrete lore about the setting later as I clean up bad files.
