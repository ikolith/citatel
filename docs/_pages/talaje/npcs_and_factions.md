NPCs are in two places, npcs.csv (which is used for automation, cards, etc.) and the more detailed text posts on this page. Ideally, every NPC would exist in both. Instead there are several NPCs that only exist in one form or the other right now. Some NPCs like Legions are unlikely to see an entry in npcs.csv due to the way they are generated, some NPCs in npcs.csv are fairly minor and have not gotten an entry here yet.

Most NPCs at this point, especially if they were created created early on, are pretty straightforwardly "evil" or at least hostile. This is because I needed to test combat and I needed some more NPCs with a little less nuance, NPCs that would start fights immediately. As things progress one would hope they get a little more well rounded.

Additionally, the vast majority of NPCs will have no entry here, they just have an entry in the .csv.
