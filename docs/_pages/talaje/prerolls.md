These are example characters that you can use as inspiration, a starting point, or use (almost) as-is to jump into a game. The mechanics are all dealt with for you. You do have to name them and describe them yourself.

Currently, any entities will be described using the clean_name and wrapped in {}.

This is not done, but it is done enough that it can stop clogging up /_drafts.
