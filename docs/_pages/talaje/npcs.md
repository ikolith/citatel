NPCs are split across two places, npcs.csv (which is used for automation, cards, etc.) and the more detailed text posts on this page. Ideally, every NPC exists in both. There are several NPCs that only exist in one form or the other right now. Some NPCs like Legions are unlikely to see an entry in npcs.csv due to the way they are generated, and some NPCs in npcs.csv are fairly minor and have not gotten an entry here.
