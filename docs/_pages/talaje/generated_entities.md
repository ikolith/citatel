## Spoilers Ahead

This page tchok-full of spoilers. This is all the content in the entity tables (as of the last time I generated this doc, of course). If you want to avoid spoilers and/or filter the entities you see, the currently available tools are the discord bot and the Python command line interface in the repo (cli.py).

There will probably be better online documentation generators down the line. This is here for the sake of completeness and because I thought it couldn't be *that* hard to get them all up here.
