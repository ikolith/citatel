The members of the Most Esteem'd Talaje College of Linguistics and Shitposts has not decided how they want the linguistics/language content presented. I hear they have a radical new illuminated manuscript in the works, a definitive reference for the modern academic.  

I don't know anything else. I do not know what is going on in language/ on account of my illiteracy. When I try to sneak into language/ they beat me with brooms for tracking mud through the halls. Maybe you will have better luck. [Link here](https://github.com/loafee/citatel/tree/main/docs/unincorporated_content/talaje/language).
