title: Known Issues and Todo

- Most of the content lives in YAMLs, not on this website. There is no good generated connection anymore, not since the switch to YAMLs from CSVs.

- Scores are too cheap, skills are two expensive. Skills all cost basically the same amount, that seems bad.

- Armor probably needs a rework

- Need a more thoroughly described procedure for turn-taking, what level of initiative we are currently at, when to announce such a thing

<!-- TODO: make a lot more NPCs and prerolled characters (make .yamls for the prerolls). -->
<!-- TODO: make a random N or PC character generator (probably focus on N) -->
