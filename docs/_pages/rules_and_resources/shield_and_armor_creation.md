title: Shield and Armor Creation
---
These mechanics have much less testing done on them than most others. They will likely see a lot of changes.

Shields and armor share the same doc because of their mechanical and functional similarities. Both are primarily defensive equipment, both can be used to alter a characters To-Hit, and both can be used for type-specific ((B)ludgeoning, (P)iercing, (S)lashing) damage reduction.

### On Balancing Damage Reduction

Damage Reduction is very good. Every time you would take damage of a certain type, you first get to subtract your damage reduction of that type. There is no limit to how many times this can happen per turn, so if you have armor with 3 Bludgeoning damage reduction (notated "-3(B)") and you're hit 3 times with bludgeoning weapons for 3 or more damage, you get to ignore 9 damage. Most characters start with 18 HP total so this is a pretty big advantage. Also, it's completely passive.

Because damage reduction works every time you take damage, it's much better against  lighter weapons and faster attacks. This often includes ranged weapons and attacks.  

Armor tends to be better against slashing and bludgeoning and worse against piercing, though of course it depends on the type of armor.  

Armor, at least anything more than light armor, should have requirements. The same is true of shields.  

Shields should generally increase to-hit and give some small amount of damage reduction while armor should give more damage reduction and generally lower to-hit scores.

### Armor Breaking

Shields and armor are meant to be somewhat disposable. They take hits so you don't have to. They break down over time because of attacks with armor breaking properties. Armor breaking happens before damage reduction, but the armor user can choose how to allocate armor breaking ("armor" or damage reduction from a shield counts as armor for the purposes of armor breaking). So if you only have -3(S) but get hit by a slashing move with 3 armor breaking you lose all of your armor and don't avoid any damage.

## Types of Armor

Before I go over the different types of armor I want to quickly note that the quality of armor and the degree to which armor protects you will vary wildly, especially in a game where you can make up new and magical materials.  

I'm going to quickly go over some different armor types, examples, and mechanical implications.

#### Fabric/Textile/Padded Armor

This tends to be the cheapest, most common, lightest, and least effective type of armor. It tends to be better against bludgeoning, okay against slashing, poor against piercing.

#### Chain Mail

Tends to be excellent against slashing, okay or poor against piercing, and it tends to do little to nothing against bludgeoning damage. This tends to be fairly expensive and heavy but finding armor that fits is relatively easy.

#### Semi-Flexible Armor

This category includes brigandines or any armor that consists of small rigid overlapping pieces attached to a fabric or leather structure, like scale armor. This is quite expensive and fitting this sort of armor is not very easy. Getting into this armor also takes a while.  
It is excellent against slashing damage, and better at dealing with both piercing and bludgeoning damage than chain mail. This sort of armor is generally more balanced than chain mail. 

#### Plate, Fully Rigid Armor

Typical medieval metal plate armor is extremely good at dealing with slashing damage, very good at dealing with bludgeoning, and though it might be worse against piercing, it's still very good. Your best bet when fighting someone with plate will probably be to attack between joints or destroy the armor with heavy crushing attacks. You will likely need a specialized weapon to deal with metal plate.  

It is extremely expensive, very heavy, hard to store, hard to put on, and hard to transport. Knights tended to require multiple animals and a squire. Full plate is a hard thing to balance a game around, and it was much more rare than you might have been lead to believe.  

Given that this is a ttrpg, you can create more balanced sorts of rigid or plate armor, say something made out of giant crab shell or something. In this case, plate is still pretty good against every sort of damage, especially slashing, just maybe not as much as fine metal plate. 

### The Availability of Shields and Armor

The availability of armor and shields in your game is something to consider carefully. Not everyone needs to always be wearing some kind of armor all the time. Armor is expensive and cumbersome, it probably isn't the case that every traveler you pass is wearing armor. If that is the case that should be used to say something about the setting and the world.  

### Making and Finding Shields and Armor / The Current State of Armor Creation / Notes Notes Notes

When making shields and armor, some degree of randomness is useful to express the different qualities and condition of the armor. Because of armor breaking attacks, armor will not last forever. If you're fighting through a long dungeon and you find armor in better condition than your hacked apart armor, you should probably switch.  

There are not currently rules for armor fitment. Maybe there should be. There are a couple okay-ish options that I might list here later, but nothing has seemed quite good enough.  

Because specific values matter less for armor and shields and the range for damage reduction is smaller than the range for weapon damage, specific examples of shields and armor are generated from a set of rolls and modifiers. Often but not always this includes some minimum damage reduction. More guidelines should come later, but again, armor has had a lot less testing done than weapons.

<!-- It would of course be good to get more shields of a greater variety, some center grip vs. strap shields, etc. https://youtu.be/xLuRHCaIcb0 -->
