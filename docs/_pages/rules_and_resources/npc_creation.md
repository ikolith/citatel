NPCs are described mechanically in the same way that a player is described, so NPC generation doesn't differ much from character creation. NPCs meant for combat are not very different from NPCs not meant for combat.  
NPCs can be generated a variety of ways, there can be simple NPCs with a couple of stats and basic weapons and there can be NPCs like Legions which have a whole unique process for generation.
<!-- TODO: that vvv but for the yamls -->

<!-- In this doc I'm going to focus on creating enemies for addition to the NPC .csv, but the same ideas can be used to create NPCs on paper or in some other system. When generating and using NPCs, you should always leave room for improvisation. Like any other system, this system should aid improvisation and spontaneity. -->

## Why randomize?

Sometimes we roll dice to determine an NPCs, HP, possessions, etc. This is to introduce another layer of unpredictablility. Most players will, intentionally or not, quickly figure out how much HP a mob normally has after a couple of fights. Randomization is used to make NPCs a bit less predictable. Templated randomization is there to do some work for the DM and speed up NPC generation. If the result of randomization doesn't make sense in the context of the game, don't use it. If you think the fight or story would be better if an NPC had or did not have something, just give it to them. At every point randomization and generators should make your life easier. DMs shouldn't defer to them over their own judgment about a situation.   
Most NPCs will carry things like money, bandages, etc. That sort of thing does not necessarily need to be specified.

### What should stats feel like?

This table describes what different STR scores feel like.

| STR Score | Description                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -3        | You need medical attention.                                     |
| -2        | You are extremely weak. You can barely wield a weapon.          |
| -1        | You are very weak.                                              |
| 0         | You are able-bodied.                                            |
| 1         | You are strong. You get a lot of exercise                       |
| 2         | You are extremely strong.                                       |
| 3         | You have reached elite level strength.                          |
| 4         | You are freakishly strong, able to do the seemingly impossible. |

Other qualitative score tables may be added eventually but they're not necessary. These characterizations can be pretty effectively generalized. 0 is an unremarkable quality or level of ability. 1 and 2 indicate unusual proficiency or a notable quality. 3 tends to indicate expert or elite level, anything above that is superhuman.
