This is currently much more of a design-standards-doc for myself than it is a good reference for others.

# Intro, What even are "skills"

"Skills" are broadly any feature that can be purchased with SP that changes the intrinsic characteristics or abilities of a character. Skills can be centered around combat, social interactions, they can allow a character to jump a chasm or track another character, they can even be as simple as raising a character's max health.

# Combat Skills

## Damage Augmentation

The first thing any character wants in combat is to do more damage. They will want to pick up skills that let them increase damage, but how should their damage be increased? Here I've listed some of the mechanics that might be used for damage augmentation, pros and cons, and some potential interactions.

### Adding a Flat Number

This is stable but boring. I'm going to refer to "adding a flat number" as AFN in this section, because otherwise I write the phrase a thousand times.  
At its best, AFN keeps a skill or advantage predictable. It works well with one-off sorts of skills, a +X when lying, a +X to disguise, as long as all of those flat plusses are large enough to feel impactful. 
The big problem with AFN is that because it is stable and unlikely to have unintended interactions its tempting to make everything AFN, but interesting interactions are a *good* thing. Flattening everything down to AFN makes the game a good deal more boring. A game that is riddled with +1s that players and DMs will forget about is AFN at its worst.  
Right now many social skills add +2 to certain rolls. It helps that they are all adding +2, rather than some at +3, some at +1. A +2 is a big deal when a complete success comes from passing a DC by 3, but +2 is not so impactful for damage rolls.  
Most of flaws with AFN go away if the boost is temporary. AFN should rarely show up in damage and in passive skills, especially those related to combat. It's just not very interesting and it doesn't interact with other skills meaningfully.

### Adding a SCORE to Damage
 
Adding a SCORE is the more interesting Adding a Flat Number. Say you have a skill that lets you add your STR to the damage rolls of two-handed weapons. You could have another skill that raises your effective STR when wielding a two-handed weapon. If you get a two-handed weapon that already scales with STR you suddenly have a fantastic combination, you're raising your STR and then adding it twice with every hit. You may find other items, invocations, and conditions that help you boost this even more. This is good, this is intended. Adding STR to damage will keep being useful in new ways and it opens the door for interesting interactions. Of course adding a score, like most of these damage augmentation mechanics, favors fast weapons.

### Reroll a Damage Die

This can allow for interesting gambles but it requires players to make decisions about the attack and the damage even *after* the damage roll. This mechanic asks them to roll *again* when in general we're trying to avoid wasting time with extraneous rolling. This should be used sparingly, if at all. The player has to remember to decide whether to use it and then they might have to redo some damage calculations. I'm not super interested in this. Outside of damage this might be cooler.

### Max a Damage Die

This one is very interesting and will cause some interesting problems down the line. I am gravitating toward making a lot of damage increase mechanics happen when one rolls the max on a damage die. Like a small crit. Doubling the damage of a die on max is normally relatively balanced, it's a +1 to EV for a fair die. However, once you introduce maxing a damage die as a mechanic, mechanics like doubling on max or even just bigger dice become a lot more valuable. Is that a problem? Maybe!

This is a good clean mechanism for increasing the damage a player does but in combination with other damage mechanisms which activate on a max roll it might just end up defining every character that uses it.

### Double on a Max Roll

EV is +1 but it seems a lot more exciting than just a +1. With big dice like a d12 this could lead to massive damage. Maxing a damage die too easily can break this mechanic.

### Exploding Damage Dice

This suffers from a similar problem that "Reroll a Damage Die" suffers from, it could mean extra rolling *after* the damage roll is already done. It slows down the game, so it's alright for something like a sneak attack, but the mechanic should be used sparingly.

### Inflict Status

This one feels very interesting to me, though let's see if it ends up feeling good in a game. Inflicting a status could let you set up later moves and it can help players deal with really big enemies with damage over time. If players are whipping statuses with buildup around all the time, this could create a headache for the DM. The obvious statuses a player might inflict with a skill are [bleed], [vulnerable], and [prone]. There is no [stun] mechanic, but maybe there should be!
 
## Required Conditions for Combat Skills

One way to shape or limit combat skills is to require that some condition is met first. The most obvious examples are the Sneak Attack skills. They're very powerful, but they all require that an enemy is [vulnerable] or even completely unaware of the character. This can be done with mundane skills like Sneak Attack, but it can be done even more easily for arcane combat abilities, a move that requires an enemy to have [curse] for example.

## Some More Parts for Combat Skills

- Make strikes cheaper.
- Increase cost, increase damage.
- More likely to hit.
- Lower defender AP.
- Lower defender move speed.
- Lower defender SCORE.
- Stop defender movement.
