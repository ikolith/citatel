title: Character Sheets, Handouts, Tables
---

Character sheet available for download [here]({{site.url}}/citatel/downloads/handouts/playersheet.pdf). Maybe that should be a flashy button.
<!-- i *cannot* get {{ site.url | relative_url }} to work here and i have no idea why, i have to add /citatel manually and it feels bad. -->

All of the entity tables can be accessed in Github [here](https://github.com/loafee/citatel/tree/main/docs/_data/entities). The entity tables should be embedded nicely in this site at some point soon but right now the site has some issues nicely rendering tables of that size. The table previews in Github look a lot better. Additionally, you can download the tables from Github and open them in your preferred editor.

A new handout with universal/standard skills will be made available once I revise the old one.
