title: A Note on the Code
---

The code is currently able to search for entities, generate plaintext entries for them and, optionally, generate any entities that the entities reference, anything that *those* entities reference and so on. It is also able to compile lists of entities  using filters and use those lists to generate printable cards for those entities. Cards can also be generated using any list of entities. The two best ways to access this code are cloning the repo and setting it up locally or interacting with the Discord bot.

Take a look at [bot.py](https://github.com/loafee/citatel/blob/main/bot.py) and [cli.py](https://github.com/loafee/citatel/blob/main/cli.py) in the [repo](https://github.com/loafee/citatel) for more information.
