### What is all this?

"citatel" is the website. It is public home of "tactile", the system.  

The "sixtem" is the use of 2d6 for checks and contests with attributes centered around 0. "tactile" is that plus all the other rules. There are two reasons for the distinction. The first is that they were written independently, while "tactile" was being created several different dice, combinations of dice, and attribute mechanics were used. The second more important reason is that "sixtem" is a fun name and I like it. The distinction between "tactile" and "sixtem" is post-hoc and not important.

"Talaje" is the only extant setting for any of these mechanics. It includes npcs, weapons, skills, etc. etc. You can change it, take parts of it for your own setting, or throw it all out and make something completely unrelated. Everything here is meant to be open, portable, and modular. You can fork the repo and just do whatever.

### What kind of game is this?

The game is built to be modular and easily customizable, you could use the base rules to make all sorts of games, etc. etc.  

For the rest of this doc I'll be talking about 
the intent behind the game presented in this site as a whole, including the setting.  

The player characters are not inherently special. They follow the same rules and use all of the same mechanics that NPCs use. The game is about normal people making their way through a dangerous and fastastic world.  

### Tone and Goals

The world is much bigger than you and it moves without any concern for you. When you meet a creature there is no expectation that you are able to kill it. If you pick a fight you can't win, that's on you. Your character might lose a limb. They might die. That's an intended part of the game. The game is not built to make you straightforwardly more powerful over time, but that doesn't mean you have no agency. You have resources to advance your character. If you want more health, you choose to spend your limited resources on health. You do the same if you want a skill or set of skills. Your character should grow in response to the pressures they face. Characters become better at what they try to do, they do not progress smoothly along a given plan. There are no classes and no levels. There is no destination. There are only small people and their unreasonable efforts and goals.

In combat there are skills for fantastic magic powers but there are also skills for quickly drawing a weapon, disarming an opponent, parrying a blow, and effective use of a shield. Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, different weapons have different AP cost, different reach, they might be better at slashing than piercing. The idea is that you think carefully about what you take with you and what you can do with it. The reason for the great historical variety of weapons is that different designs work better in different contexts and for different purposes. I'd like a game that lets you engage with that dynamic and expands on it with interesting mechanics. Having weapons that depend on context seems better than weapons being either strictly better, worse, or the same for a given character. Those weapons need to stay relatively simple, no tables, nothing that can't fit on a small card.

In general, the context you find yourself in at any point should be hugely important. Say you have a very advanced knight character with all sorts of skills. He's in heavy armor standing guard. There's a relatively early-game character who has specialized in stealth and sneak attacks. The sneaky character has a long thin dagger meant for slipping through armor. The sneaky character manages to catch the knight unaware, he prepares himself and gets a sneak attack on the knight, driving the dagger through his neck. The knight does not merely take *double damage*. He's likely dead. In a direct fight the sneak attacker would have no chance at all. This, basically, is how balance is handled (or not handled). Most exchanges are not so one sided but in any case, the quality of skills, weapons, and character types depend on context and creativity. If you're that knight standing guard, you probably want to invest in your perception, you probably want someone watching your back. In general, you should be thinking about what other people might try, you should be thinking about your vulnerabilities and how you're going to deal with them.

The world won't be pulling any punches so you *should* be looking for every advantage you can get. Combat is not orderly. You should be trying to cheese encounters.  You should be trying to break the game. The flexibility of the system should give you absolute freedom to engage with combat in whatever way seems fun or interesting to you. You can set up status effects and conditions to trigger very powerful moves, you can dodge and weave around attacks finding an opening for a critical strike, you can use illusion and deception, you can just make an unga-bunga character that wields a club made from a whole tree. This might be a weapon that was clearly never meant to be wielded by a player character, but you found it in a swamp and have so many Giant Weapon skills that you can use it to completely flatten anything in your path. You could also just talk your way out of a fight or sneak around and avoid the interaction entirely. Set up distractions, traps, bribe someone so you find out your enemies weaknesses beforehand. The way that you deal with situations should be unique to your character and your skillset.

An old wizard beset by bandits doesn't have 10 times as much Health as they do because he's read so many spell books. He might even have less health than they do. However, he has the tools and knowledge to make such an encounter trivial. If he gets stabbed a bunch of times despite all of this it will be very bad and not just 3d4 damage out of his 50 health.

There are games that make you feel a lot more powerful and are far better suited to playing out the story of a legendary adventurer who went from hunting rats to slaying dragons. This is not that. This is a game about (relatively) normal people exploring, finding things, and beating genuinely bad odds with quick thinking, preparation, and luck.

On top of all this, the game should be relatively rules-light. When rules show up they should add to the tactility of the world not take it away. They should give you more options, they should be easy to improvise and *easy to improvise with*. There should be no superfluous rules for "realism". While there is a baseline of universal rules and mechanics, a player should largely get to choose what specific mechanics they use to interact with the world, whether that's risk-reward mechanics, complex chained effects, AP cleverness, Big Numbers, thinking of the perfect illusion at the perfect time, or social charm. Players aren't restricted to one class or the options in that class, they can combine skills and mechanics in any way they can manage.

These are a lot of goals in this doc. The currently existing game is an attempt at those goals. Many of these goals are in a great deal of tension with one another. But this is the game I've wanted to play for a while, so let's see how this goes.

## Why is this game on a website, why isn't this just a PDF?

I think the way we distribute games sucks. I will make a separate poast about this.
