title: Salt, Mist, HYLIC, PSYCHIC

## HYLIC and PSYCHIC 

Two new stats are introduced in Talaje. These are HYLIC and PSYCHIC. PSYCHIC is used for channeling and accessing powers beyond oneself. It's used for fine manipulation of complex things far away. PSYCHIC is the main score for mist related magic. HYLIC is for exerting control over the immediate, the physical, and the self. HYLIC allows you to efficiently and effectively manipulate SALT to augment physical abilities. It roughly maps to a force of will, embeddedness within the physical world and control of one's own body. If you are using an external resource and shaping yourself or the world through yourself, it is HYLIC.  

HYLIC for SALT.
PSYCHIC for MIST. 

## SALT

"Salt" comes in two forms. The first is the alchemically active SALT found deep in the earth or in the End (this is used as a magical resource, so to avoid confusion it's written in all caps, "SALT"). The second is any adulterated form of the first, including the sort of salt used in cooking. Alchemical SALT can be transformed into a much larger amount of conventional salt, or it might be used to fuel some spell. SALT is the most common currency in the End and especially underground. SALT is measured in "flakes" denoted "f". 1 full unit of SALT used in casting is equivalent in mass to 100f. SALT when ingested and used as a casting resource is like [poison] or [bleed], it's a status effect tracked by tokens. Sometimes this is notated as [SALT]. [SALT] naturally wears off at the rate of 1 [SALT] per hour. Having [SALT] equal to or greater than 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn causes you to take 20 damage. 

### Casting, but Salty

There are two common ways to use [SALT], "burning" over a long period, typically an hour, and "flaring", or spending a lot of [SALT] in a short period for a larger effect. Flaring lasts anywhere from a single move to several hours depending on the ability. Burning and flaring both cost about 1-3 [SALT], typically. Anyone can learn to burn [SALT] though doing so is dangerous.

#### SALT/HYLIC Casting Rules

- If your [SALT] is above 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn, take 20 damage and lose 1 [SALT].
- The total amount of [SALT] you are burning and flaring at any one time cannot exceed your HYLIC score (though your [SALT] itself *can* exceed your HYLIC).
- While you are burning [SALT] for an ability, that [SALT] still counts towards your total [SALT]. If you choose to shut off an ability before it would naturally go away, the ability ends, but the [SALT] still has to go away naturally. 

## MIST

Mist/PSYCHIC rules coming soon.

<!-- #### Chitinous Strata (1 SP)

Requires: 1 HYLIC  

(2n1) to start. Continuously burn 1 SALT for 1 hour. Generate a layer of salt armor with (-1d6 B, -1d8 P, -1d8 S). Lower your to-hit difficulty by 1. While using Salt Armor, you're able to use an unarmed attack of +AGI to hit, 1d4 (B) [range: close]. Disadvantage on anything requiring fine motor skills. You cannot wear other armor while using this ability. You can use this ability multiple times.
Flare Effect: Must currently have Salt Armor. Burn 1 Salt. Triple armor bonus from this source for 1 turn. 

#### Violent Accretion (1 SP) Requires: 1 HYLIC  

Requires: 1 HYLIC

(1n1) to start. Continuously burn 1 SALT for 1 hour. Salt rapidly accrues on an arm, covering it in thick plates and amplifying its strength. While using Violent Accretion you have minimal use of the hand, it is like a giant gauntlet with few joints and no finger separation. Take disadvantage on anything requiring fine motor skills, and take disadvantage when using other weapons. When using Violent Accretion the arm functions as the following weapon:

[one-handed] [range: close]  
Speed: (1n1)->(2n1) To Hit: 2*STR  
- 1d8+STR (B)

If flared for 1 SALT, lasting for 1 attack:

[one-handed]
Speed: (2n1) To Hit: 2*STR
- 1d8 (B) 2d8 (P) +STR

#### Salubrity

Requires: 1 HYLIC  

This ability allows you to augment scores and abilities by burning SALT. This skill will probably have to be streamlined, rewritten.
(1n1) to start all of these moves.
STR: Increase STR by 2 for 1 hour by continuously burning SALT.
CON: Increase CON by 2 for 1 hour by continuously burning SALT.
Both of these can be flared to increase by 1 more for 1 minute.  

If you have at least 2 HYLIC: 

AGI: Increase AGI and move speed by 1 and move for 1 hour by continuously burning SALT. Can be flared for 1 SALT to leap 6 spaces.
PERCEPTION: Increase perception by 1 for 6 hours by continuously burning SALT, can replace 4 hours of sleep. Can be flared by burning 1 SALT to add +3 to checks made with one sense for 5 minutes. -->

<!-- ### Notes on other moves not available at the start of the game, that exist elsewhere.

- Ability that requires 3 HYLIC, and requires burning 3 SALT. If you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, stay at 1 HP.
- Way of Constant Secretion: The patented crust punk move, always be gaining 1 SALT, can't sleep.
- Ability to shift what attribute you are using between STR CON and AGI with Salubrity. -->

<!-- # Some Gameplay and Move Notes on MIST and PSYCHIC

MIST abilities are rarer to start with than SALT, and users of MIST are less trusted or understood. Where SALT damage is more bludgeoning/piercing heavy, MIST is more slashing/grappling/debuff/manipulation heavy. Where the SALT resource is external, the MIST resource is "internal", you can lower your own stats in order to pull more from the mists, (mist is more... up in the air right now. Mist allows you to create entities, or pseudo entities made of mist which you can manipulate for attacks or utility. Mist users typically have vessels they store some mist in and keep on hand. Mist is exhaled, and requires focus on the breath. Mist users must be able to breathe. Mist requires concentration to maintain channeling. Mist use might be aided by some kind of mask. If certain conditions are met, like the destruction of the mists or sudden involuntary separation from the mists, the user does not get their stats or resources back immediately, they must recover slowly. MIST is less directly combat oriented than SALT. Fire is a hard counter to mist.

#### More Mist Notes More Specific

When exhaling mist, the default behaviour is a (4? 5?) radius sphere centered on yourself. It should be big enough to create ambiguity and give you options, but not so big that it defines the entire combat for everyone just by the fact of your using it.  
Mist users can wear strange masks that allow them to shape the mists in different ways, in lines, in cones, being able to have the circle centered anywhere as long as they would be within it, etc.

# More Rules, Other Forces in the Salt Mines

These are sort of opposed to each other but it's more complicated than that, think less two sides, more circle of fifths. Better yet, think of a better analogy.

| Salt  | Water |
| ----- | ----- |
| Fire  | Mist  |
| Sun   | Moon  |
| Light | Dark  |

And fuckin'... oil? Oil, fire, food, can't mix with water, feels like there's something there.

### Water

You need water to not die, it's heavy, and it's going to put a hard limit on your ability to explore. 
Occasionally you might find freshwater wells in the caves, this is as close to a holy place as there is in the mines, and is a natural checkpoint.

### Saltwater

Useless, despised. Home of the reviled.

### Fire

You need it to see, and it's a man's best tool against the mists.

## The Mist

Inscrutable, mysterious, terrible, bearing great promises and things you don't understand.  
The mist might contain a jungle of enormous beings from the deep or a festival of mistings.

# The People of the Salt Mines and Caves, (under construction)

### Salt Wretches

Dead miners, shriveled pitiable things.

### Salt Miners

Shriveled pathetic things.

### The Suncursed Wanderer

This name fucks, figure something out.

### Mistings

Among this group are:

- Enormous pale blind deep sea creatures with teeth in many rows, able to continuously create mist to suspend themselves, preferring to follow the wandering mists.

- Entire civilizations. 
  
- The whispering dead.

Deep sea fey with many teeth, keepers of arcane knowledge, associated with the moon, the water, and the dark, in addition to the mists. Old. 

### The Reviled

The Reviled live in the useless putrid saltwater, saltwater not considered suitable for any dignified or intelligent sort of life.  
They are often pacifists. They teach that that there is no difference between the HYLIC and the PSYCHIC, and that there is no self either. Both schools are ways of engaging with the singular being that everything is. HYLIC starts from the apparent self, raising it up and building outward into the world. PSYCHIC rejects the self as illusory and builds paths from without, from the great universal total, towards ones self, unseating the self and communing with the other. Truly, the saturants say, this is just a pragmatic and frankly lazy path to understanding everything. No bridges need to be built, the only thing that is needed is to recognize the inherent unity of all things. Everyone fucking hates these guys.

The following section really only applies to the Salt Mine setting, or a similar setting that plays liberally with real-world places.

They call prefer to call themselves "Saturants". They claim their own place in the celestial order by associating not with the sun or moon, but with Saturn, claiming the rings around Saturn to be an endless river of salt. They are ignored. One has to wonder how they found out about Saturn to begin with.

>Players engaging with the Reviled can learn of a cosmology relating major and minor celestial bodies as:  

Sun/Salt -> Mars
Moon/Water -> Neptune
Where Saturn is actually unified, with the planet as the major body and the rings as the minor.  
If this Neptune/Mars thing is brought up to mistings or certain human/fire related factions they might believe the players must be very important or wise for knowing this, or they might believe the players must have stolen some knowledge, must be some liability, and become hostile.  

The Reviled can deploy an especially debilitating saltmist, might keep some secrets of healing?

## Molemen  

I don't know what to call these. Hateful little molemen that weaken the rock and set traps of collapsing rock to hunt and kill. Know a lot about the caves.  
Though some are very gross some are, like golden moles, downright [precious](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/7b/ed/ac7bed8646ebeaddc4f8268589d98c40.png).
