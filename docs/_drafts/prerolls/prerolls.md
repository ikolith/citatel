title: Pre-Rolls
---

These are example characters that you can use as inspiration, a starting point, or use (almost) as-is to jump into a game. The mechanics are all dealt with for you. You do have to name them and describe them yourself.

Currently, any entities will be described using the clean_name and wrapped in {}.

TODO: maybe link to generated entity .mds... or maybe some python process... goes through and replaces, fills those curlies??

TODO: Create generated .mds from the entity tables. If this TODO is still here that means it hasn't been done.

TODO: This will be the parent page for a docs/_preroll/ collection.
