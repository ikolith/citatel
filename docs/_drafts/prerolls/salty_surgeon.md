Quick warning: this character asks more from you than some of the other pre-gens. There are  parts of the character's motivations, methods, and some mechanical details that have to be fleshed out in your game.

### SALTy Surgeon

You're a surgeon. You are absolutely convinced that by manipulating the physically augmenting properties of SALT you can revolutionize medicine. You will save countless lives, your likeness will be carved into stone, your name will be known by every medical student.  

However, your tests and studies required huge amounts of SALT to conduct. Others just don't *understand* this or the importance of your work. SALT is a an extremely valuable substance from the End, getting it transported to you was incredibly expensive. You first got a hold of SALT by securing grants at the academy. Of course, they did not give you enough. They wouldn't give you the funds you needed even though you were so close to an answer. Naturally, you took out loans that you could easily pay back once you finally made that breakthrough. You pawned your possessions. You lied, you went hungry, and finally you embezzled obscene amounts of money from your department. 

Unfortunately, while you're a great liar, you're a terrible accountant. Soon after the investigation was started, men were pounding at your door in the night. Thankfully, you always jam a chair against the door, clutch your bag of SALT to your chest when you sleep, and sleep fully clothed. You downed the vial of SALT you always keep around your neck, felt the power of it surge through your body, jumped out of the window, and fled down the alley.  

You're a wanted man now and you have no way of paying your debts. You've thrown away your career. You cannot return home now. At least, not until proving them all wrong. You need to show them how they forced your hand, how they held back progress. You'll show them why you did what you did and how the world will benefit.  

You knew exactly where to go next. You went to the source of the SALT. You turned east and set out for the End.
