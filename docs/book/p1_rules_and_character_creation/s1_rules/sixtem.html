<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-characters-work">How Characters Work</h2>
<p>A basic character consists of a a list of attribute scores, a defense score, movement speed, and max HP (Health Points). The particular values for HP, defense, etc. will vary. Here is an example:</p>
<p>HP: 18 + (6*CON), Defense: 6, Movement Speed: 4</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>ATTRIBUTE</th>
<th>SCORE</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>STR(ENGTH)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>AGI(LITY)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DEX(TERITY)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CON(STITUTION)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>PER(CEPTION)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SOC(IAL)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A given character might also have skills, an inventory, conditions, or any number of other things. The names of attributes are typically shortened to the first three or four letters.</p>
<p>A character with 0s all the way down their sheet is analogous to someone who is generally healthy, without any notable deficiencies or strengths. Having 0 in a score does not mean you cannot perform actions related to that score. You can have a negative score in an attribute. A -3 in a score means you can’t perform actions related to that score and anything you do related to that score fails.</p>
<section id="hp-defense-and-move-speed" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hp-defense-and-move-speed">HP, Defense, and Move Speed</h3>
<p>HP represents the characters health, CON increases your max HP by 6 * CON. When someone rolls to hit you, they are rolling their To-Hit check against your Defense. Move speed is how many spaces the character can move across at a time.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-scores-and-attributes-used-for">What are scores and attributes used for?</h3>
<p>Scores are most commonly used as modifiers. For example, if you have 2 STR and use a weapon that is +STR To-Hit, you add 2 to your roll To-Hit. Scores are also used as prerequisites for obtaining skills or using certain weapons. Learning to pick pockets might require some minimum DEX, a giant club might require some minimum STR for effective use.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="passive-scores">“Passive” Scores</h3>
<p>When you roll “against” someone else’s score the number you have to beat, or “Difficulty Class” (or DC) is 6 + SCORE. The passive participant doesn’t roll (another way of thinking about it is that they are “assumed” to have rolled a 6). This is covered in greater detail in the section on checks and contests.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-on-scores-and-attributes">More on Scores and Attributes</h3>
<p>If you’re asked to perform a check with a score that you don’t see on your sheet, you can assume your score is 0 unless otherwise stated or the score has the [special] tag.</p>
<section id="special-scores" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="special-scores">[special] Scores</h4>
<p>If you attempt to perform any action with a [special] score you don’t have, nothing happens. PYROMANCY is a [special] score. Having a PYROMANCY of 0 on your sheet means you are a mediocre pyromancer, not having PYROMANCY on your sheet means you are not a pyromancer. Sometimes the [special] tag is notated [s] for the sake of brevity.</p>

<section id="standard-scores" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standard-scores">“Standard” Scores</h4>
<p>“Standard” scores are non-[special] scores that are very common or important in a given setting. In a fantasy setting STR is likely “standard” while MEDICINE is not. If you’re playing in a sci-fi setting with spying, hacking, and intrigue, TECH(NOLOGY) might be standard while AGI(LITY) is not. In this book STR, AGI, DEX, CON, PER and SOC are the standard scores.</p>

<section id="doing-things" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="doing-things">Doing Things</h2>
<p>When you’re trying to do something that you might fail at e.g.&nbsp;hitting someone with an axe or jumping over a chasm, you roll two six sided dice (notated 2d6) and add the relevant score. This number is your “roll”. To figure out if you succeed, you compare your roll to the “Difficulty Class”. The DC might be determined by the GM, or it might be determined by something in the world, like the abilities or attributes of another character. If the DC is stable and dependent on some fact about the world, it’s a check. If the DC is dependent on another character’s roll, then it’s a contest. When two characters roll opposing rolls, that’s a contest. When one character rolls, that’s a check.</p>
<section id="double-1s-double-6s" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="double-1s-double-6s">Double 1s, Double 6s</h3>
<p>Double 1s are critical failures, they are context dependent. If you roll double 1s in combat, your GM might give you a couple different failures you can choose from, or if you are playing a more cinematic game you might improvise a failure. The GM could also just tell you what happens as a result of your failure. If you roll double 6s in combat, roll double damage dice and get 1 Temp AP. If you roll double 6s outside of combat, you perform whatever action you were trying to perform as well as you could have.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performing-a-check-against-a-score">Performing a Check Against a Score</h3>
<p>When a check is made “against a score”, the DC is 6 + SCORE. If you’re trying to poison someone and have to roll “against” their CON the DC is 6 + CON. The character that initiated the action and rolls is the “active” party, or “attacker”. The party that is being rolled against is the “passive” party, or “defender”. Defender wins ties.</p>

<section id="an-example-of-a-contest" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example-of-a-contest">An Example of a “Contest”</h3>
<p>Contests directly compare the efforts of two characters. Arm wrestling is a good example of a contest. There’s no obvious number you have to beat, you just need to do better than the other guy. When participating in contests, you roll and then compare your roll to the “opposing” roll. If there’s is a tie, the person with the higher relevant score wins. If <em>that’s</em> a tie, either treat it as a tie in game, or if that makes no sense, do the contest again.</p>
</section>
<section id="an-example-of-a-check" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example-of-a-check">An Example of a “Check”</h3>
<p>You might decide that you want to jump a large chasm, your GM tells you to roll agility (AGI), so you roll 2d6 and add your AGI score. The GM knows the DC which in this example might be 8. If you pass the DC you succeed. If you don’t, you fail, and the GM decides how that’s resolved.<br>
You will almost never know the DC of a check before you try it, and you might not even know afterwards if the GM decides not to tell you. However, you should be able to get a good idea of a DC by the GMs description of the situation or by asking questions. If the GM describes the chasm as nearly impossible to jump over, you can be sure you’re looking at a DC above 10, probably around 12. If the GM says the gap is pretty small, barely worth worrying about, you can guess it’s probably a DC around 3 or 4.</p>

<section id="ap-moving-and-the-ap-tracker" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ap-moving-and-the-ap-tracker">AP, Moving, and the AP Tracker</h3>
<p>Action Points (AP) are the resource you use to do anything and everything. Characters have 3 AP unless otherwise stated. AP is regained at the beginning of every round. Every round takes about six seconds.</p>
<p>The AP cost of an action has two parts, the number of AP spent to perform the action and the number of rounds you have to wait to get that spent AP back. That is, “X AP cost, return the AP in Y turns”, or “X in Y”, notated as “(XnY)”. Most basic actions (including moving) are (1n1). You spend 1 AP to do it and you get that AP back at the beginning of the next round. There are some exhausting or difficult spells that might have a cost like (2n3 or 3n1). If you see “or”, you can choose either cost when you perform the action.</p>
<p>You can move a number of spaces equal to your speed (typically 20 feet or 4 spaces) for every move action you take. Move actions cost (1n1). Doing basic tasks like pulling a lever costs (1n1). Minor tasks like speaking or dropping something are free actions, you can do a “reasonable” amount of free actions during your turn, up to GM discretion.</p>
<p>You are always <em>conceptually</em> spending AP to do things, but you only have to track it in a context where several characters are trying to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen matters. Most often this is combat.</p>
<section id="moves-that-have-multiple-costs" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moves-that-have-multiple-costs">Moves that have Multiple Costs</h4>
<p>If you see a move that looks like “(1n1)-&gt;(2n1)-&gt;(3n1)” then the first time you do that action on your turn you pay the first cost, the second time you pay the second cost, the third time you pay the third. You’ll notice there is no fourth cost. If you want to use the move again (and had sufficient AP!), you would just pay the last listed cost again, (3n1).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ap-tracker" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ap-tracker">The AP Tracker</h4>
<p>You can track your AP by using the AP tracker on the top of your character sheet, it is the four boxes in a row numbered 0-3. Put three tokens on the tracker at “0”, these represent your AP. You can spend any AP that is at 0. When you spend AP, move the tokens for the spent AP to the box on the tracker with the number corresponding to the number of rounds that you have to wait to get the AP back. At the start of every round, move all tokens one space to the left (closer to 0) unless they’re already at 0.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example. You start with 3 AP at the “0” space so you have 3 AP to spend. You perform an action that is (2n2) so you move 2 tokens to the “2” square. You then “move”, which is (1n1), so you move 1 token from the “0” square to the “1” square. You’re out of AP. At the start of the next round you move all of the tokens one box to the left, so you have 1 token at “0” and 2 tokens at “1”. That means you can spend 1 AP this turn. You decide to move, which is (1n1), so you move 1 AP to cell “1”. Now you have all 3 tokens on the “1” cell. At the start of the next round, all tokens move one step down, so they all go to the “0” cell and you have 3 AP to spend again.</p>
<p>By using this tracker you should never have to remember how many AP you’re supposed to have or when you get them back, you just spend AP that is at “0” and move all tokens to the left at the start of the round.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pulling-it-all-together-an-example-of-attacking-using-ap">Pulling it all together, an example of attacking using AP</h4>
<p>Let’s say you have a longsword in one hand and you’re fighting a guy with chainmail armor. The longsword has a Basic Attack AP cost:“(1n1)-&gt;(2n1)”. It also has a slashing (S) move that does a d8 in damage as well as a piercing (P) move that does a d6 of damage. You slash first, paying (1n1). This does poorly against the opponents chain mail, so you try to the piercing attack for (2n1) (the second AP cost, because this is the second time you’ve used an attack this turn) and this does better, you get through more of your opponents armor. You don’t have enough AP to do a third attack, but if you did it would cost (2n1).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ap-shenanigans-temp-ap-losing-ap-gaining-ap-the-wait-action">AP Shenanigans: Temp AP, Losing AP, Gaining AP, the “Wait” action</h3>
<p>“Temp AP” goes right into the “0” cell where you can spend it. It only lasts until the beginning of the next round.</p>
<p>Some moves might make you lose an AP, this means you take the furthest token from 0 off the tracker. Some moves and conditions make you gain an AP. Whenever you gain AP it goes to 0 where you can spend it. If you have less than 3 AP, you just add an AP at 0. If you have 3 AP on the tracker and a move makes you “gain” AP, you don’t get an extra one, you just move one AP that is furthest from 0 to 0. So if you have one token on “2” and two tokens on 3 and something causes you to “gain” an AP, move an AP from square 3 to 0.</p>
<p>You can always “wait” for a round. If you “wait”, you can do nothing else during that round. Gain 1 AP at the beginning of the next round. if you have no AP to spend, you might as well “wait”.</p>

<section id="initiative-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="initiative-rules">Initiative Rules</h2>
<p>The initiative rules are used to cover any situation where several characters are trying to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen matters. Most often this will be combat but this can also be a chase scene, a race, or any other time the story is focused on action.</p>
<p>The ruleset that follows has not been tested much and will likely see some changes. This is the current state.</p>
<p>A character’s initiative score is their AGI + or - any relevant bonuses or penalties.</p>
<p>The initiative scores of the players should always be public on some form of initiative tracker. As other characters reveal their initiative, they should be added to the tracker (and removed when they are no longer relevant).</p>
<p>Every round is divided into two phases, the Beginning Phase and the Main Phase.</p>
<section id="beginning-phase---beginning-of-the-round" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beginning-phase---beginning-of-the-round">Beginning Phase - “Beginning of the Round”</h3>
<p>This is mostly referred to as the “beginning of the round” by skills and effects. The whole table does not need to be synced up for this, everyone can manage their own character. There are three sub-phases to the beginning of the round. Most of the time this will not matter and you won’t have to think about it, but if there are multiple things that happen “at the beginning of the round” this describes the order in which they happen.<br>
If there are multiple things that happen in the same sub-phase, you get to choose the order in which they happen.</p>
<section id="effect-activation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="effect-activation">1. Effect Activation</h4>
<p>Any <em>already active</em> effects that trigger “at the beginning of a round” happen now. They happen before anything else in the round does. This includes taking damage from [poison] or [bleed] or gaining health from [heal]. If you have an effect active that causes you to do some sort of rolls or contests, do those now.</p>
</section>
<section id="status-management" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="status-management">2. Status Management</h4>
<p>At this point any effect or mechanic that involves rounds passing is accounted for. AP is regained a, a point of [poison] is removed, a point of [heal] is removed, anything that would end at the “beginning” of this round ends <em>now</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="moves-and-skills" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moves-and-skills">3. Moves and Skills</h4>
<p>Some moves and skills get can be used “at the beginning of the round”. These can only be used <em>after</em> effects happen and then are managed and AP is regained.</p>
</section>
<section id="increasingly-complicated-examples" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="increasingly-complicated-examples">Increasingly Complicated Examples</h4>
<p>Say you have 1 HP, 1 [poison], and an ability that causes [poison] to heal you instead of harm you which can be used at the beginning of the round. The order in this case matters, do you reduce [poison] by 1 first and avoid the damage? Can you use the ability before the damage from [poison] kicks in? No and no. First damage happens, then you remove the [poison], and then you can use an ability (though in this hypothetical you would already be at 0 HP).<br>
Let’s say that instead of having an ability that lets you heal from [poison], you already have an effect active that makes poison heal you. In this case you would heal 1 HP from the poison damage and then remove the poison.</p>
<p>An even more complicated example: let’s say that in addition to the passive healing [poison] effect you have an item that activates when you would take [poison] damage and nullifies the damage. In this case you have two effects that happen in the same phase, so do you heal from the poison or ignore the poison? In the case of this sort of tie, you get to choose. Presumably you would choose to heal which means the item would not be triggered because its no longer the case that you <em>would otherwise</em> take poison damage.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="main-phase" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-phase">Main Phase</h3>
<p>This is where basically everything in the round happens.</p>
<p>If you want to do something, you say what you want to do. If multiple characters want to do something at the same time, the order they take actions in is based on their initiative. If there is a tie of two or more characters, the character that went most recently goes last, the character that went most recently before them goes second to last, etc. If several characters haven’t gone yet, roll a contest between them.</p>
</section>
<section id="interrupting-and-interrupt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interrupting-and-interrupt">Interrupting and [interrupt]</h3>
<p>If you want to directly interfere with another character’s action roll an initiative contest. Spend (1n1) when you attempt to interrupt. If you win you act first. The opponent can still take their action afterwards. You cannot attempt to interrupt the same action twice.</p>
</section>
<section id="coordinating-actions-around-the-table" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coordinating-actions-around-the-table">Coordinating Actions around the Table</h3>
<p>Say Alice has 3 initiative, Bob has 2, and both try to do something at the start of every round. Alice is faster than Bob and will always end up going before (“overruling”) Bob, but some time is wasted establishing that <em>every single round</em>. We want to minimize these sorts of predictable action-taking collisions.</p>
<!-- This method of turn coordination was made to capture three ideas.
- Characters with higher initiative will always overrule characters with lower initiative, so characters with higher initiative should be given an opportunity to go before characters with lower initiative.
- Characters with lower initiatives can't be blocked from taking any action because they can always attempt to interrupt a character with higher initiative.
- Characters with higher initiative can still take actions after characters with lower initiatives have started taking actions. -->
<p>The DM announces the highest level of initiative present according to the initiative tracker and gives those characters a chance to take actions. Once those characters have had a chance to act, the DM announces the next level of initiative and so on down the list. At the end of the list the DM should have a “last call” for actions and then announce the start of a new round.</p>
<p>Slower characters can attempt to interrupt faster characters at any time. Characters can keep acting as long as they have the AP to do so, even if they already had a chance to take actions.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-only-the-amount-of-coordination-that-you-need" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-only-the-amount-of-coordination-that-you-need">Using Only the Amount of Coordination that You Need</h3>
<p>In the section above, all of the rules for initiative and when-exactly-effects-happen were explained, but often you won’t need to actively use all of these rules. It will probably be useful to make every step very explicit for beginners, but once players have a handle on how this system works, combat should be able to function without every step being made explicit, rules for determining who goes first can just be invoked when there is some conflict. You can choose to invoke rules for “phases” only when there are many effects that seem to happen at the same time and there is some reason why the order matters.</p>
<p>As an example, in a fight between two people the DM doesn’t need to be announcing the current highest level of initiative, there are at most two levels! The combatants will quickly figure out who is faster. The DM <em>will</em> often have to determine when the new round starts in combat, but this isn’t always true either. If there are only two combatants and they’re out of AP they can just agree to start a new round. Of course, the DM could still overrule them and describe something external happening that neither expected before they get a chance to start a new round.</p>
</section>
<section id="zooming-out-in-initiative" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="zooming-out-in-initiative">“Zooming Out” in Initiative</h3>
<p>In the case of a tense duel between two arcane assassins that fill the air with daggers, poison gas, spells, and counterspells during their combat, a high degree of detail with regard to action priority and beginning-of-round effect activation is appropriate. Sometimes you do not want this.</p>
<p>In the case of a large fight between many characters, it can be appropriate to figure out an order based on initiative and give every character a turn, where in their turn they choose how to spend their AP and then they have to wait until their next turn. You might decide you prefer the game this way most or all of the time. That’s fine. Try a couple of different things, figure out what level of detail or orderliness fits your group or the context of the story and use that. Not every story or scene in a story will describe action in the same way.</p>
