<!-- "Sixtem", "Tactile", and "Talaje" were split into three pages for a while, good chance that is still the move! -->
<section id="terminology-and-disclaimers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="terminology-and-disclaimers">Terminology and Disclaimers</h2>
<p>“GM” is “Game Master” which is interchangeable with “Dungeon Master”, “Referee”, etc. They run the game, control the NPCs, etc. GM fiat overrides everything. “TTYGM” is “Talk to Your GM” and is used to call out things that you should definitely ask your GM about before you proceed. Rules can be overwritten by more specific rules or effect text. Every rule is “unless otherwise specified”.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the rules are grouped into three sections: “Sixtem”, “Tactile”, and “Talaje”.”Sixtem” is the core ruleset, this includes how checks and attributes work. “Tactile” includes roles for mechanics like social interactions, combat, and being reduced to 0 HP. “Talaje” covers setting specific rules and mechanics.</p>
</section>
<section id="sixtem" class="level1">
<h1>Sixtem</h1>
<section id="how-characters-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-characters-work">How Characters Work</h2>
<p>A basic character consists of a a list of attribute scores, a defense score, movement speed, and max HP (Health Points). The particular values for HP, defense, etc. will vary. Here is an example:</p>
<p>HP: 18 + (6*CON), Defense: 6, Movement Speed: 4</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>ATTRIBUTE</th>
<th>SCORE</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>STR(ENGTH)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>AGI(LITY)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>DEX(TERITY)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>CON(STITUTION)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>PER(CEPTION)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SOC(IAL)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A given character might also have skills, an inventory, conditions, or any number of other things. The names of attributes are typically shortened to the first three or four letters.</p>
<p>A character with 0s all the way down their sheet is analogous to someone who is generally healthy, without any notable deficiencies or strengths. Having 0 in a score does not mean you cannot perform actions related to that score. You can have a negative score in an attribute. A -3 in a score means you can’t perform actions related to that score and anything you do related to that score fails.</p>
<section id="hp-defense-and-move-speed" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hp-defense-and-move-speed">HP, Defense, and Move Speed</h3>
<p>HP represents the characters health, CON increases your max HP by 6 * CON. When someone rolls to hit you, they are rolling their To-Hit check against your Defense. Move speed is how many spaces the character can move across at a time.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-scores-and-attributes-used-for" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-scores-and-attributes-used-for">What are scores and attributes used for?</h3>
<p>Scores are most commonly used as modifiers. For example, if you have 2 STR and use a weapon that is +STR To-Hit, you add 2 to your roll To-Hit. Scores are also used as prerequisites for obtaining skills or using certain weapons. Learning to pick pockets might require some minimum DEX, a giant club might require some minimum STR for effective use.</p>
</section>
<section id="passive-scores" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="passive-scores">“Passive” Scores</h3>
<p>When you roll “against” someone else’s score the number you have to beat, or “Difficulty Class” (or DC) is 6 + SCORE. The passive participant doesn’t roll (another way of thinking about it is that they are “assumed” to have rolled a 6). This is covered in greater detail in the section on checks and contests.</p>
</section>
<section id="more-on-scores-and-attributes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-on-scores-and-attributes">More on Scores and Attributes</h3>
<p>If you’re asked to perform a check with a score that you don’t see on your sheet, you can assume your score is 0 unless otherwise stated or the score has the [special] tag.</p>
<section id="special-scores" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="special-scores">[special] Scores</h4>
<p>If you attempt to perform any action with a [special] score you don’t have, nothing happens. PYROMANCY is a [special] score. Having a PYROMANCY of 0 on your sheet means you are a mediocre pyromancer, not having PYROMANCY on your sheet means you are not a pyromancer. Sometimes the [special] tag is notated [s] for the sake of brevity.</p>
</section>
<section id="standard-scores" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standard-scores">“Standard” Scores</h4>
<p>“Standard” scores are non-[special] scores that are very common or important in a given setting. In a fantasy setting STR is likely “standard” while MEDICINE is not. If you’re playing in a sci-fi setting with spying, hacking, and intrigue, TECH(NOLOGY) might be standard while AGI(LITY) is not. In this book STR, AGI, DEX, CON, PER and SOC are the standard scores.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="doing-things" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="doing-things">Doing Things</h2>
<p>When you’re trying to do something that you might fail at e.g.&nbsp;hitting someone with an axe or jumping over a chasm, you roll two six sided dice (notated 2d6) and add the relevant score. This number is your “roll”. To figure out if you succeed, you compare your roll to the “Difficulty Class”. The DC might be determined by the GM, or it might be determined by something in the world, like the abilities or attributes of another character. If the DC is stable and dependent on some fact about the world, it’s a check. If the DC is dependent on another character’s roll, then it’s a contest. When two characters roll opposing rolls, that’s a contest. When one character rolls, that’s a check.</p>
<section id="performing-a-check-against-a-score" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performing-a-check-against-a-score">Performing a Check Against a Score</h3>
<p>When a check is made “against a score”, the DC is 6 + SCORE. If you’re trying to poison someone and have to roll “against” their CON the DC is 6 + CON. The character that initiated the action and rolls is the “active” party, or “attacker”. The party that is being rolled against is the “passive” party, or “defender”. Defender wins ties.</p>

<section id="an-example-of-a-contest" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example-of-a-contest">An Example of a “Contest”</h3>
<p>Contests directly compare the efforts of two characters. Arm wrestling is a good example of a contest. There’s no obvious number you have to beat, you just need to do better than the other guy. When participating in contests, you roll and then compare your roll to the “opposing” roll. If there’s is a tie, the person with the higher relevant score wins. If <em>that’s</em> a tie, either treat it as a tie in game, or if that makes no sense, do the contest again.</p>

<section id="an-example-of-a-check" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example-of-a-check">An Example of a “Check”</h3>
<p>You might decide that you want to jump a large chasm, your GM tells you to roll agility (AGI), so you roll 2d6 and add your AGI score. The GM knows the DC which in this example might be 8. If you pass the DC you succeed. If you don’t, you fail, and the GM decides how that’s resolved.<br>
You will almost never know the DC of a check before you try it, and you might not even know afterwards if the GM decides not to tell you. However, you should be able to get a good idea of a DC by the GMs description of the situation or by asking questions. If the GM describes the chasm as nearly impossible to jump over, you can be sure you’re looking at a DC above 10, probably around 12. If the GM says the gap is pretty small, barely worth worrying about, you can guess it’s probably a DC around 3 or 4.</p>

<section id="action-points-ap-moving-and-the-ap-tracker" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="action-points-ap-moving-and-the-ap-tracker">Action Points (AP), Moving, and the AP Tracker</h3>
<p>Action Points (AP) are the resource you use to do anything and everything. Characters have 3 AP unless otherwise stated. AP is regained at the beginning of every round. Every round takes about six seconds.</p>
<p>The AP cost of an action has two parts, the number of AP spent to perform the action and the number of rounds you have to wait to get that spent AP back. That is, “X AP cost, return the AP in Y turns”, or “X in Y”, notated as “(XnY)”. Most basic actions (including moving) are (1n1). You spend 1 AP to do it and you get that AP back at the beginning of the next round. There are some exhausting or difficult spells that might have a cost like (2n3 or 3n1). If you see “or”, you can choose either cost when you perform the action.</p>
<p>You can move a number of spaces equal to your speed (typically 20 feet or 4 spaces) for every move action you take. Move actions cost (1n1). Doing basic tasks like pulling a lever costs (1n1). Minor tasks like speaking or dropping something are free actions, you can do a “reasonable” amount of free actions during your turn, up to GM discretion.</p>
<p>You are always <em>conceptually</em> spending AP to do things, but you only have to track it in a context where several characters are trying to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen matters. Most often this is combat.</p>
<section id="moves-that-have-multiple-costs" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moves-that-have-multiple-costs">Moves that have Multiple Costs</h4>
<p>If you see a move that looks like “(1n1)-&gt;(2n1)-&gt;(3n1)” then the first time you do that action on your turn you pay the first cost, the second time you pay the second cost, the third time you pay the third. You’ll notice there is no fourth cost. If you want to use the move again (and had sufficient AP!), you would just pay the last listed cost again, (3n1).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ap-tracker" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ap-tracker">The AP Tracker</h4>
<p>You can track your AP by using the AP tracker on the top of your character sheet, it is the four boxes in a row numbered 0-3. Put three tokens on the tracker at “0”, these represent your AP. You can spend any AP that is at 0. When you spend AP, move the tokens for the spent AP to the box on the tracker with the number corresponding to the number of rounds that you have to wait to get the AP back. At the start of every round, move all tokens one space to the left (closer to 0) unless they’re already at 0.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example. You start with 3 AP at the “0” space so you have 3 AP to spend. You perform an action that is (2n2) so you move 2 tokens to the “2” square. You then “move”, which is (1n1), so you move 1 token from the “0” square to the “1” square. You’re out of AP. At the start of the next round you move all of the tokens one box to the left, so you have 1 token at “0” and 2 tokens at “1”. That means you can spend 1 AP this turn. You decide to move, which is (1n1), so you move 1 AP to cell “1”. Now you have all 3 tokens on the “1” cell. At the start of the next round, all tokens move one step down, so they all go to the “0” cell and you have 3 AP to spend again.</p>
<p>By using this tracker you should never have to remember how many AP you’re supposed to have or when you get them back, you just spend AP that is at “0” and move all tokens to the left at the start of the round.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a longsword in one hand and you’re fighting a guy with chainmail armor. The longsword has a Basic Attack AP cost:“(1n1)-&gt;(2n1)”. It also has a slashing (S) move that does a d8 in damage as well as a piercing (P) move that does a d6 of damage. You slash first, paying (1n1). This does poorly against the opponents chain mail, so you try to the piercing attack for (2n1) (the second AP cost, because this is the second time you’ve used an attack this turn) and this does better, you get through more of your opponents armor. You don’t have enough AP to do a third attack, but if you did it would cost (2n1).</p>

<section id="initiative-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="initiative-rules">Initiative Rules</h2>
<p>The initiative rules are used to cover any situation where several characters are trying to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen matters. Most often this will be combat but this can also be a chase scene, a race, or any other time the story is focused on action.</p>
<p>The ruleset that follows has not been tested much and will likely see some changes. This is the current state.</p>
<p>A character’s initiative score is their AGI + or - any relevant bonuses or penalties.</p>
<p>The initiative scores of the players should always be public on some form of initiative tracker. As other characters reveal their initiative, they should be added to the tracker (and removed when they are no longer relevant).</p>
<p>Every round is divided into two phases, the Beginning Phase and the Main Phase.</p>
<section id="beginning-phase---beginning-of-the-round" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beginning-phase---beginning-of-the-round">Beginning Phase - “Beginning of the Round”</h3>
<p>This is mostly referred to as the “beginning of the round” by skills and effects. The whole table does not need to be synced up for this, everyone can manage their own character. There are three sub-phases to the beginning of the round. Most of the time this will not matter and you won’t have to think about it, but if there are multiple things that happen “at the beginning of the round” this describes the order in which they happen.<br>
If there are multiple things that happen in the same sub-phase, you get to choose the order in which they happen.</p>
<section id="effect-activation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="effect-activation">1. Effect Activation</h4>
<p>Any <em>already active</em> effects that trigger “at the beginning of a round” happen now. They happen before anything else in the round does. This includes taking damage from [poison] or [bleed] or gaining health from [heal]. If you have an effect active that causes you to do some sort of rolls or contests, do those now.</p>
</section>
<section id="status-management" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="status-management">2. Status Management</h4>
<p>At this point any effect or mechanic that involves rounds passing is accounted for. AP is regained a, a point of [poison] is removed, a point of [heal] is removed, anything that would end at the “beginning” of this round ends <em>now</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="moves-and-skills" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moves-and-skills">3. Moves and Skills</h4>
<p>Some moves and skills get can be used “at the beginning of the round”. These can only be used <em>after</em> effects happen and then are managed and AP is regained.</p>
</section>
<section id="increasingly-complicated-examples" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="increasingly-complicated-examples">Increasingly Complicated Examples</h4>
<p>Say you have 1 HP, 1 [poison], and an ability that causes [poison] to heal you instead of harm you which can be used at the beginning of the round. The order in this case matters, do you reduce [poison] by 1 first and avoid the damage? Can you use the ability before the damage from [poison] kicks in? No and no. First damage happens, then you remove the [poison], and then you can use an ability (though in this hypothetical you would already be at 0 HP).<br>
Let’s say that instead of having an ability that lets you heal from [poison], you already have an effect active that makes poison heal you. In this case you would heal 1 HP from the poison damage and then remove the poison.</p>
<p>An even more complicated example: let’s say that in addition to the passive healing [poison] effect you have an item that activates when you would take [poison] damage and nullifies the damage. In this case you have two effects that happen in the same phase, so do you heal from the poison or ignore the poison? In the case of this sort of tie, you get to choose. Presumably you would choose to heal which means the item would not be triggered because its no longer the case that you <em>would otherwise</em> take poison damage.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="main-phase" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-phase">Main Phase</h3>
<p>This is where basically everything in the round happens.</p>
<p>If you want to do something, you say what you want to do. If multiple characters want to do something at the same time, the order they take actions in is based on their initiative. If there is a tie of two or more characters, the character that went most recently goes last, the character that went most recently before them goes second to last, etc. If several characters haven’t gone yet, roll a contest between them.</p>
</section>
<section id="interrupting-and-interrupt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interrupting-and-interrupt">Interrupting and [interrupt]</h3>
<p>If you want to directly interfere with another character’s action roll an initiative contest. Spend (1n1) when you attempt to interrupt. If you win you act first. The opponent can still take their action afterwards. You cannot attempt to interrupt the same action twice.</p>
</section>
<section id="coordinating-actions-around-the-table" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coordinating-actions-around-the-table">Coordinating Actions around the Table</h3>
<p>Say Alice has 3 initiative, Bob has 2, and both try to do something at the start of every round. Alice is faster than Bob and will always end up going before (“overruling”) Bob, but some time is wasted establishing that <em>every single round</em>. We want to minimize these sorts of predictable action-taking collisions.</p>
<!-- This method of turn coordination was made to capture three ideas.
- Characters with higher initiative will always overrule characters with lower initiative, so characters with higher initiative should be given an opportunity to go before characters with lower initiative.
- Characters with lower initiatives can't be blocked from taking any action because they can always attempt to interrupt a character with higher initiative.
- Characters with higher initiative can still take actions after characters with lower initiatives have started taking actions. -->
<p>The DM announces the highest level of initiative present according to the initiative tracker and gives those characters a chance to take actions. Once those characters have had a chance to act, the DM announces the next level of initiative and so on down the list. At the end of the list the DM should have a “last call” for actions and then announce the start of a new round.</p>
<p>Slower characters can attempt to interrupt faster characters at any time. Characters can keep acting as long as they have the AP to do so, even if they already had a chance to take actions.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-only-the-amount-of-coordination-that-you-need">Using Only the Amount of Coordination that You Need</h3>
<p>In the section above, all of the rules for initiative and when-exactly-effects-happen were explained, but often you won’t need to actively use all of these rules. It will probably be useful to make every step very explicit for beginners, but once players have a handle on how this system works, combat should be able to function without every step being made explicit, rules for determining who goes first can just be invoked when there is some conflict. You can choose to invoke rules for “phases” only when there are many effects that seem to happen at the same time and there is some reason why the order matters.</p>
<p>As an example, in a fight between two people the DM doesn’t need to be announcing the current highest level of initiative, there are at most two levels! The combatants will quickly figure out who is faster. The DM <em>will</em> often have to determine when the new round starts in combat, but this isn’t always true either. If there are only two combatants and they’re out of AP they can just agree to start a new round. Of course, the DM could still overrule them and describe something external happening that neither expected before they get a chance to start a new round.</p>

<p>In the case of a tense duel between two arcane assassins that fill the air with daggers, poison gas, spells, and counterspells during their combat, a high degree of detail with regard to action priority and beginning-of-round effect activation is appropriate. Sometimes you do not want this.</p>
<p>In the case of a large fight between many characters, it can be appropriate to figure out an order based on initiative and give every character a turn, where in their turn they choose how to spend their AP and then they have to wait until their next turn. You might decide you prefer the game this way most or all of the time. That’s fine. Try a couple of different things, figure out what level of detail or orderliness fits your group or the context of the story and use that. Not every story or scene in a story will describe action in the same way.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ap-shenanigans-temp-ap-losing-ap-gaining-ap-the-wait-action">AP Shenanigans: Temp AP, Losing AP, Gaining AP, the “Wait” action</h2>
<p>“Temp AP” goes right into the “0” cell where you can spend it. It only lasts until the beginning of the next round.</p>
<p>Some moves might make you lose an AP, this means you take the furthest token from 0 off the tracker. Some moves and conditions make you gain an AP. Whenever you gain AP it goes to 0 where you can spend it. If you have less than 3 AP, you just add an AP at 0. If you have 3 AP on the tracker and a move makes you “gain” AP, you don’t get an extra one, you just move one AP that is furthest from 0 to 0. So if you have one token on “2” and two tokens on 3 and something causes you to “gain” an AP, move an AP from square 3 to 0.</p>
<p>You can always “wait” for a round. If you “wait”, you can do nothing else during that round. Gain 1 AP at the beginning of the next round. if you have no AP to spend, you might as well “wait”.</p>

The GM could also just tell you what happens as a result of your failure. If you roll double 6s in combat, roll double damage dice and get 1 Temp AP. If you roll double 6s outside of combat, you perform whatever action you were trying to perform as well as you could have.</p>

<h1>Tactile</h1>
<section id="weapon-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weapon-rules">Weapon Rules</h2>
<p>A weapon has a Speed, a To-Hit, and a set of basic attacks. The speed is how much AP it costs to do attacks with the weapon. The “To-Hit” is what you add to the check you perform when attempting to hit an enemy. This looks like “To-Hit: DEX” or “To-Hit: STR + AGI” or similar. To-Hit and Speed are both shared for all attacks a weapon has, but each attack can have different damage, different damage types, different effects, and different tags. The three basic damage types are (B)ludgeoning, (P)iercing, and (S)lashing.</p>
<p>Let’s go through an example. Say the speed of the weapon is (2n1) and the To-Hit is +STR, it has one attack: “1d6+STR (B) eswinging: leading]”. When attacking with this weapon, you move 2 AP tokens to the 1 space and roll 2d6+STR for your To-Hit check. If that beats your opponents Defense, roll damage (1d6+STR) and tell the GM that the damage type is (B)ludgeoning.</p>
<p>Some skills require attacks with certain tags like eswinging: leading] or they might only effect certain damage types. Some weapons will specialize in attacks of different types types. This captures how a rapier is better for quick piercing attacks than it is for slashes while a giant curved greatsword would be better at heavy slashing moves. A weapon like a rondel dagger (a long dagger with a narrow but thick blade) is able to ignore some armor and do pretty good damage with a piercing attack, but it will be a good deal worse at slashing than a kukri. If you’re in the jungle being attacked by big furry creatures, take a kukri. If you’re assassinating knights, take a rondel dagger.</p>
<section id="attack-tags-in-a-more-detail" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attack-tags-in-a-more-detail">Attack Tags in a More Detail</h3>
<p>The two major tag types are [thrusting] and [swinging]. [swinging] has three sub-types. Those three types are [swinging: following], [swinging: neutral], [swinging: leading]. The subtype refers roughly to “the position of the striking surface relative to the hand in a given swing” but this is much easier to understand through some examples.</p>
<p><strong><em>[swinging: leading]</em></strong> is the easiest to understand. It’s a swinging attack where the striking head is ahead of the weapon as in a warpick, an axe, or a hammer. The blade of the axe projects in front of your hand, it is “leading” the swing. These sorts of attack are typically slower and deal more damage. A (S) [swinging: leading] attack would be like swinging a meat cleaver or an axe, the wound from a [swinging: leading] (S) attack will be relatively short but deep. A [swinging: leading] (B) is like an attack with a hammer, a [swinging: leading] (P) attack is like an attacks with a warpick. You can expect to see attacks with any of the three damage types with this tag.</p>
<p><strong><em>[swinging: neutral]</em></strong> is the middle ground, attacks of this type will be faster than [swinging: leading] but do less damage. This is where the striking surface is in line with the hand as in a longsword (S), a quarter staff (B), or some sickles (P). You’ll see (S) and (B) attacks of this type most often. In general (P) damage is less common for [swinging: neutral] attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>[swinging: following]</em></strong> is the oddest of the bunch. Attacks of this sort tend to be the fastest and weakest, relying on skills, conditions, or just an overwhelming flurry of attacks for damage. The central example of [swinging: following] is a curved dueling sabre. These attacks will nearly always be (S). You can construct weapons that have (P) [swinging: following] attacks, but they don’t make a huge amount of sense. What would a (B) [swinging: following] attack be? Maybe hitting a guy with the scabbard for your saber. Again, not very common. Magic abilities, skills, and exotic weapons can flesh out this category but there aren’t many historical examples of [swinging: following] besides curved swords and some glaives.</p>
<p><strong><em>[thrusting]</em></strong> includes thrusts with a spear, sword, or dagger. The vast majority of thrusting attacks have the (P) damage type.</p>
<!-- 
***[pulling]*** attacks are rare. They show up in  some hooked polearms or hook swords. They typically do (S) damage and can involve some kind of grapple check.

So rare that they don't currently exist in the typsetting code... and there are no weapons that use the tag yet! So I'm leaving this out for now. 
-->
<p>These tags describe something physical about the weapon, “striking surface relative to swing” or just the motion as in the [thrusting] tag, but more importantly the tags describe the way the weapon is <em>used</em> for the attack. They describe how the attack <em>feels</em>, what kind of motion is done in the attack. A slow-ish sword with a slightly curved blade might still be counted as [swinging: neutral] if those are the sorts of attacks the weapon is made for, if that makes more sense for skills, etc. If you want more info about these distinctions and how weapons are made, refer to the <a href="weapon_creation.md">Weapon Creation doc</a>.</p>
<p>Other weapon tags are possible, such as the [pulling] tag which belongs to scythes, some polearms, and hook swords. These are less important, and they don’t get their own glyphs, they exist for niche weapons and skills.</p>
<!-- #### An Aside on Notation

Unfortunately, the tag \[swinging: leading] ends up taking about as much space as the rest of the attack despite being on of the less important elements of the attack. When making cards or other reference material we replace these tags with glyps. ▲ for \[thrusting], ▷▷▶ for \[swinging: leading], ▶▷▷for \[swinging: following] etc. These are rendered a little more nicely in pdf reference material. The glyphs should be pretty intuitive, the filled triangle indicates the striking head relative to the swing (or the subjective "aggressiveness" of the attack). -->

<p>Dropping a weapon is a free action. Putting a second hand on a one-handed weapon is a free action, same for removing a hand from a weapon or any such minor adjustment, if in doubt TTYGM.

<p>An example: You want to drop your [two-handed] greatsword, pick up a handaxe from the ground, and draw your dagger. Dropping the sword is free, picking up the handaxe is (1n1), as is picking up the dagger. You’ve spent 2 AP, and you were [vulnerable] for a bit.</p>

<p>On the turn a player is downed and on every subsequent turn, the player rolls a death check and tells the DM their roll. If their roll matches or passes the DC it’s a success. If the roll is below the DC, it’s a failure. If the roll is a failure, the DM notes by how much the roll failed, DC - roll. This difference will be used to determine the consequence of the failure using the consequence table.

<p>3 successes means the character stabilizes at their current HP. 3 failures means they die.</p>
<p>Once they either hit 3 successes or 3 failures, the DM tells them to stop rolling. They are not told whether they died or not or what consequences they might have. They only find out once someone goes to check on their character.</p>

<section id="social-rolls" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-rolls">SOCIAL Rolls</h2>
<p>Now for the least important part of playing a TTRPG, interacting with other people. This system is designed to allow a characters skills and stats to <em>augment</em> their social actions. The emphasis is not on getting good rolls, but on saying or doing the right thing. Rolls are used to express a particular character’s social talents, but they don’t replace the content of what the character says or does.</p>
<p>A GM can use a check to determine success if they really do not know whether a given social action should or shouldn’t work on some character, and neither a success nor failure would be especially interesting. Even in this case, difficulty should be determined contextually. Grading numerical difficulty for a social interaction is generally difficult. A GM cannot prepare beforehand for the things a player will do or say, so DCs have to be set on the fly. Sometimes they are set incorrectly or something breaks. In this case, ignore the system/roll and do whatever is the most sensible/interesting/funny.</p>
<p>Social skills are divided into two sets: communicative skills and perceptive skills. communicative skills include persuasion, deception, and performance. Perceptive skills include sensing motives, detecting deceit, and gaining insight into another character’s emotional state.</p>

</table>
<p>The framework for setting a DC for a given social roll and the framework for reputation management are the same and they can be used in combination. Both systems share the same table of scores with rough characterizations of what each score “feels” like.</p>
<p>The scores range from -6 (“Reviled”) to +6 (“Revered”). These scores can be used by a GM to easily keep track of relationships and attitudes. They are also mechanical modifiers. If a character is at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”) with some group or individual, you treat their social roll as lowered by 2 (or you can just raise the DC by 2).</p>
<p>You can use these scores to set a sort of “default” attitude or bias for NPCs. The kindly innkeeper in a small peaceful town might treat every new person at around +2 (“Well-Liked”). The sneering guards in front of a keep might treat everyone at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”). Another traveler on the road just trying to get to where they’re going might be at -1 (“Disliked”) just because they really don’t want to stop and chat. The same traveler might, if you help them out, switch to +1 (“Liked”).</p>
<p>The purpose of social rolls is to be able to, in a given interaction, change the way people perceive you or interact with you. Remember that rolling checks with the SOCIAL score does not replace the content of what a character does or says, but just augments it. If a player passes the DC, treat their interaction as happening at 1 point higher than it would be otherwise. If the player exceeds the DC by more than 3, you can treat the interaction as being at 2 points higher than it would be otherwise.</p>
<p>Say a player character is in a town in which they are at -3 (“Loathed”). Typically, this would mean that they are treated as a pariah, people are unwilling to talk to them and will actively attempt to get rid of them, they might be thrown in jail on made up charges. Guards will not come to their aid. If they are very charismatic they may be able to walk into a shop, attempt to talk the owner into selling them something and succeed by 4 on a roll. The shop owner thinks that the player character really doesn’t seem quite so bad, he thinks that maybe he is misremembering something or getting this person confused with someone else. He is still wary, however. He still treats the character as -1 or “Disliked”, he will tend not to want to barter, and he’ll want to get through the interaction quickly. Similarly, a guard treating everyone at -2 might be persuaded to relax a bit and just talk to the player character on neutral terms (-2 -&gt; 0).</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of things besides social interaction that might raise or lower someone’s opinion of you, and if the content of what a player character said is something that another character would naturally agree with or go along with, then no roll is necessary. Remember that the good will from one positive social interaction does not last forever. Actions will tend to have a greater effect for longer than words. If you just stabbed someone, you are not going to be able to smooth that over with your wit and charm, you do not even get to roll.</p>
<p>The table with specific characterizations is useful, but it can be boiled down to some rules of thumb. 0 is neutral. From +1 to +3 the character is favored. Persuasion, information gathering, and bartering will be easier. People give you the benefit of the doubt. From +3 to +6 people will go out of their way to help you, they will likely come to your aid in combat or follow you into combat. From -1 to -3 people dislike you and generally do not want to have anything to do with you. -4 to -6 is when you start seeing a lot of unprovoked violence.</p>
<p>This framework is largely for the benefit of the GM, to allow them to easily keep track of attitudes and relationships and to quickly create DCs and resolve rolls in a way that rewards the skills of the player as well as the skills of the character.</p>
<p>There are several different ways a GM can deal with this system in game. The system can be player-facing, that is to say, you could tell your players their numerical reputation among different groups or numerical values for the attitudes of various characters (along with descriptions). I do not recommend this. You could gate numerical information behind something like a good insight roll. This is fine, but even in this case you should lean on qualitative descriptions of how some character treats a player character. You can also keep the entire system completely to yourself, as a useful tool for the GM to structure descriptions and interactions. In this approach players do not get to actually know numerical values and you never have to reveal or justify movements in numerical values. This is probably your best bet. In this case the framework is still useful for figuring out how much the charisma of the character has helped the efforts of the player.</p>

<section id="social-perception" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-perception">Social Perception</h3>
<p>“Social perception” is used here to refer to skills that allow you to roll to sense motives, detect deceit, and gain insight into another character’s emotional state. It’s important here to establish when <em>exactly</em> these skills are used and checks are made.</p>
<p>When a player asks a question that would fall under “social perception” about another character, they should first be given a superficial description of the character and their apparent emotional state. If the character in question seems to be at ease, the GM should just say so. This is true even if the character in question is only pretending to be at ease, but plans to attack or betray the player’s character. It does not take a roll to be told that someone yelling and brandishing a knife is probably somewhat unhappy. The rules and skills for social perception are not meant to cover the superficial. These rules are for attempts to read another character. Social perception rolls are very similar to other character conflicts, they can be either a check or a contest. v ### Social Checks</p>
<p>When the roll is a check, the DC will likely be a default DC of 6 + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills). If you are trying to read a character who is is lying the DC will be set by their initial attempt to lie, which will have been a check + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills) against your passive social perception. If they attempt to lie and fail this check, then whatever they said will be described as highly suspicious or likely a lie. If they succeed in their initial check, but you pass their DC when you attempt to read them, you will notice that something seems wrong, or suspicious, or you’ll notice strange nervous habits.</p>
<p>Social perception rolls are almost always checks. If you are lying to someone, you perform a check. If they are trying to figure out if you are lying, they perform a check. If someone is trying to convince you of something and you think they might be lying, you perform a check.</p>
<section id="social-check-resolution" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-check-resolution">Social Check Resolution</h4>
<p>In the case of a tie, resolution is the same as any other check. Defender wins. Otherwise there are four possible outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you pass the check more than 3, Complete Success:</em></strong></p>
<p>You read the defender like an open book. You get a full answer to whatever question you were asking, or as full an answer as you could get from watching someone. They crumble at your gaze. Maybe they are so caught off guard that they fumble and make an embarrassing mistake, mentioning something they should not have.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you pass the check by 3 or less, Moderate Success:</em></strong></p>
<p>You get some insight into the question you were asking. If you are trying to see if someone is lying, you’ll know that they’re certainly not telling the whole truth, that they are actively misleading you. If you’re trying to get insight into someone’s emotional state, you get a good idea of how they are feeling. You might be able to tell that someone is distressed and trying to hide it. This is a pretty good read of someone, and they do not know that you know anything.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you fail the check by 3 or less, Moderate Failure:</em></strong></p>
<p>You have no answer to your question at all and the person you were attempting to read knows the vague shape of the question you asked or that you have a question. If you were trying to figure out if someone was lying about a specific claim they might know that you don’t trust them or that you suspect them in some way. Otherwise, you might just be staring and it’s weird.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you fail the check by more than 3, Catastrophic Failure:</em></strong></p>
<p>God have mercy on your soul. You completely give yourself away, your interests and your question are written all over your face. If you are trying to catch a lie, not only is it clear what exactly you think is being lied about, it’s clear that you have <em>no</em> idea if the defender is lying. Maybe you scoffed at a specific claim, maybe you blurt out “But the stone of Macguffin!” at exactly the wrong time. Your face is very red.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="contests" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contests">Contests</h3>
<p>Contests are far rarer than checks. Social perception contests happen in contexts where it is understood that both parties are trying to advance their own interests and, if not outright lying, being very selective with the truth. Some examples of this would be a tense negotiation, an official dinner of ambassadors whose states are on the brink of war, a game of poker, spies meeting to trade secrets while not revealing their true intentions. In these cases checks would be happening simultaneously anyway, and the information that someone might doubt what you are saying or that they might not be telling the whole truth wouldn’t be very meaningful.</p>
<p>Contest Resolution is just about the same as check resolution. The difference between the rolls of the two characters determines which character succeeds and which fails, and to what degree. This success and failure are captured by the same event. For example one character might give away information they shouldn’t have, which captures both the success of one character and the failure of another.</p>
<p>Ties are just ties, a staredown, a tense silence. If your group prefers, ties can be resolved in the normal way for a contest: win goes to the higher modifier, if that’s a tie, it’s a tie in game, if that makes no sense, do it again.</p>

<section id="stealth" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stealth">Stealth</h3>
<p>Stealth is an AGI check (+STEALTH if you have it) against the defender’s passive perception. It’s a check against a passive score, and that is always 6 + SCORE.</p>

<section id="grappling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grappling">Grappling</h3>
<p>Entering grappling takes (2n1), it’s an attack + AGI To-Hit followed by a STR contest. If the part entering the grapple wins, both parties are [grappling] but only the defender is [vulnerable].

<section id="taking-a-hostage" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="taking-a-hostage">Taking a Hostage</h4>

<p>You can take 10 minutes to work at something (that you can try repeatedly at where there is no cost for failure) to treat your check as a 10 + relevant modifiers.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="encumbrance-and-rations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="encumbrance-and-rations">Encumbrance and Rations</h2>
<p>Encumbrance is measured in encs. Encs are a combined measure of weight and unwieldiness. Most weapons are 1 enc. A [heavy] weapon is 2 encs. A days worth of food and water is 1. 3 small items, like a book, a dagger, and some bandages together take 1 enc. Negligible items like quills and needles don’t take up any encs, unless the DM determines you are carrying “way too many”.</p>
<p>Players must describe and account for how they are moving their things. They take “reasonable” penalties for impractical methods. If they tie a bunch of swords together and then hang that off of their neck, they will have a hard time stealthing. If they fall over while wearing the described necklace of dangerous wind chimes they’re going to have a bad time.</p>
<section id="storage-spaces-the-personal-space-and-bags" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="storage-spaces-the-personal-space-and-bags">Storage Spaces, The “Personal” Space and Bags</h3>
<p>“Storage space” is used to broadly refer to any place you can put things. Each storage space you have can be thought of as a source of a max encumbrance and a source of an [encumbered] threshold. Most of the time you will have two storage spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your “personal” space, which includes anything you’re carrying that isn’t itself a storage space. Most often this would be your weapons and armor.</p></li>
<li><p>Your bag. This is most often some kind of backpack.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You have a personal [encumbered] threshold. This is used for the weapons and armor you are carrying without a bag. Your personal [encumbered] threshold is 3 + STR. Your personal max encumbrance is 6 + STR encs.</p>
<p>The primary use of a bag is to give you more [encumbered] thresholds and to change your maximum encumbrance.</p>
<p>Bags have varying [encumbered] thresholds and max encumbrances. If a bag does not say it has an [encumbrance] threshold, then it never makes you [encumbered]. This is common for small bags that don’t have a max encumbrance high enough to be able to encumber, or bags that are designed not to encumber.</p>
<p>Removing a bag is (2n1).</p>
<p>Searching a bag is (2n1).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-encumbered-threshold-and-maximum-encumbrance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-encumbered-threshold-and-maximum-encumbrance">The [encumbered] Threshold and Maximum Encumbrance</h3>
<p>If you are past any encumbrance threshold in any storage space, you are [encumbered], you have the [encumbered] status.</p>
<p>The [encumbered] status lowers your move speed by 1. Your Defense is lowered by 3. Additionally, take a -1 to all AGI checks.</p>
<p>If you aren’t wearing heavy armor but you’re carrying enough in your bag to pass the bag’s encumbrance threshold, you are [encumbered]. Less obviously, this also means that if you are past your personal encumbrance threshold (most likely from carrying weapons and wearing armor that are too heavy for you to move freely with) but you are not past your [encumbered] threshold for your bag, you are still [encumbered].</p>
<p>In order to avoid passing an [encumbered] threshold you likely want to spread the weight around multiple storage spaces, keeping under all of their [encumbered] thresholds, or you might want to just put everything in a bag so that in a fight you can take it off quickly and not be [encumbered].</p>
<p>You cannot carry more encs in total than your single highest max encumbrance score. This does not mean that having one storage space where you can carry 8 encs means that you must be able to carry 8 encs in every storage space, it just means that all together you can’t carry more than 8 encs.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, you can only use one bag at a time. If some mechanic allows you to use multiple bags, you cannot carry in total more than your highest max encumbrance from a single source, though you can move encs around to try to avoid the [encumbered] status effect.</p>
<p>Your [encumbered] threshold and your maximum encumbrance can be affected by status effects or skills, but most often they will be affected by the bag you are using.</p>

<h1>Talaje</h1>
<!-- Likely "HYLIC" should be "HYLIA" maybe "HYLICISM". "GNOSTIC" to "GNOSIS" maybe. -->
<!-- Two new attributes are introduced in Talaje. These are HYLIC and PSYCHIC. PSYCHIC is used for channeling and accessing powers beyond oneself. It's used for fine manipulation of complex things far away. PSYCHIC is the main score for mist related magic. HYLIC is for exerting control over the immediate, the physical, and the self. HYLIC allows you to efficiently and effectively manipulate SALT to augment physical abilities. It roughly maps to a force of will, embeddedness within the physical world and control of one's own body. If you are using an external resource and shaping yourself or the world through yourself, it is HYLIC.

HYLIC for SALT.

PSYCHIC for MIST. -->
<section id="hylic-and-salt" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hylic-and-salt">HYLIC and SALT</h2>
<p>“Salt” comes in two forms. The first is the alchemically active SALT found deep in the earth or in the End (this is used as a magical resource, so to avoid confusion it’s written in all caps, “SALT”). The second is any adulterated form of the first, including the sort of salt used in cooking. Alchemical SALT can be transformed into a much larger amount of conventional salt, or it might be used to fuel some spell. SALT is the most common currency in the End and especially underground. SALT is measured in “flakes” denoted “f”. 1 full unit of SALT used in casting is equivalent in mass to 100f. SALT when ingested and used as a casting resource is like [poison] or [bleed], it’s a status effect tracked by tokens. Sometimes this is notated as [SALT]. [SALT] naturally wears off at the rate of 1 [SALT] per hour. Having [SALT] equal to or greater than 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn causes you to take 20 damage.</p>
<section id="casting-but-salty" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="casting-but-salty">Casting, but Salty</h3>
<p>There are two common ways to use [SALT], “burning” over a long period, typically an hour, and “flaring”, or spending a lot of [SALT] in a short period for a larger effect. Flaring lasts anywhere from a single move to several hours depending on the ability. Burning and flaring both cost about 1-3 [SALT], typically. Anyone can learn to burn [SALT] though doing so is dangerous.</p>
<section id="salthylic-casting-rules" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="salthylic-casting-rules">SALT/HYLIC Casting Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>If your [SALT] is above 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn, take 20 damage and lose 1 [SALT].</p></li>
<li><p>The total amount of [SALT] you are burning and flaring at any one time cannot exceed your HYLIC score (though your [SALT] itself <em>can</em> exceed your HYLIC).</p></li>
<li><p>While you are burning [SALT] for an ability, that [SALT] still counts towards your total [SALT]. If you choose to shut off an ability before it would naturally go away, the ability ends, but the [SALT] still has to go away naturally.</p></li>
