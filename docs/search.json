    "text": "What kind of game is this?\nThe base rules should be flexible enough that they can be modified to make many types of games. That being said, the setting, weapons, etc. presented in this site are used to make a game where the player characters are not inherently special. Player characters follow the same rules and use all of the same mechanics that NPCs use.\nThe game is about normal people making their way through a dangerous and fantastic world.\n\n\nTone and Goals\nThe world of this game is much bigger than the players and it moves without any concern for them. When players meet a creature there should be no expectation that they will be able to kill it. If players pick a fight they can’t win, that’s on them. Characters might lose limbs. They might die as a part of normal combat. The game is not built to make players straightforwardly more powerful over time, but that doesn’t mean they have no agency. Players have resources to advance their characters. If a player wants more health, they choose to spend their limited resources on health. The same is true for skills. Characters should grow in response to the pressures they face. Characters become better at what they try to do, they do not progress smoothly along a given plan. There are no classes and there are no levels. There is no destination. There are only small people and their unreasonable efforts and goals.\nThere are skills for fantastic magic powers as well as more mundane abilities such as quickly drawing a weapon, disarming an opponent, parrying a blow, and effective use of a shield. Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, different weapons have different AP costs, different reach. Some might be better at slashing than piercing. A player should think carefully about what they take with them and what they can do with it. The reason for the great historical variety of weapons is that different designs work better in different contexts and for different purposes. I’d like a game that lets you engage with that dynamic and expands on it with interesting and relatively light mechanics.\nIn general, the context a character finds themselves in at any point is hugely important. Say you have a very advanced knight-type character with all sorts of skills. He’s in heavy armor standing guard. There’s a relatively weak early-game assassin character who has specialized in stealth and sneak attacks. The assassin has a long thin dagger meant for slipping through armor. The assassin manages to catch the knight unaware, prepares his strike, and drives the dagger through his neck. The knight is probably dead. In a direct fight the assassin would have no chance at all. This, basically, is how balance is handled (or not handled). The quality of skills, weapons, and character types depend on context and creativity. If you’re that knight standing guard, you probably want to invest in your perception, you probably want someone watching your back. In general, you should be thinking about what other people might try, you should be thinking about your vulnerabilities and how you’re going to deal with them.\nCombat is not orderly. You should be trying to take every advantage you can find. You should be trying to break the game. The flexibility of the system should give you the freedom to engage with combat in whatever way seems fun or interesting to you. Yan could set up status effects and conditions to trigger very powerful moves. You can dodge and weave around attacks, finding an opening for a critical strike. You can use illusion and deception. You can make a big unga-bunga man who wields a club made from a whole tree. Maybe this was a weapon that was never meant to be wielded by a player character, a weapon from some great troll boss. As long as you have the right set of attributes, you can use it. You could also just talk your way out of a fight or sneak around and avoid the interaction entirely. Set up distractions, traps, bribe someone so you find out your enemies weaknesses beforehand. The way that you deal with situations should be unique to your character and your skillset.\nAn old wizard beset by bandits doesn’t have 10 times as much Health as they do because he’s “a high level wizard”. He might have less health than they do. However, he has the tools and knowledge to make such an encounter trivial anyway.\nThere are games that are built to make you feel a lot more powerful than everyone else in the game world, games that are far better suited to playing out the story of a legendary adventurer who went from hunting rats to slaying dragons. This is not that game. This is a game about people exploring dangerous places, taking risks, and beating genuinely bad odds with quick thinking, preparation, and luck.\nOn top of all this, the game should be relatively rules-light. When rules show up they should add to the tactility of the world not take it away. They should give you more options, they should be easy to improvise and easy to improvise with. There should be no superfluous rules for “realism”. While there is a baseline of universal rules and mechanics, a player should largely get to choose what specific mechanics they use to interact with the world, whether that’s risk-reward mechanics, complex chained effects, AP cleverness, Big Numbers, thinking of the perfect illusion at the perfect time, or social charm. Players aren’t restricted to one class or the options in that class, they can combine skills and mechanics in any way they can manage.\nThese are a lot of goals in this doc. The currently existing game is an attempt at reaching toward those goals. Many of these goals are in a great deal of tension with one another."

The rules got in the way. I started a little side project to see if I could rebuild the rules (called “tactile”) into something lighter (“actlite”). “actlite” turned out to be way more fun and has become the main version of the game. I’m rewriting things to fit the new rules and mechanics, so a lot of stuff is missing.\nAlso, the Python utils should be easily usable from the site. Eventually.

Most things cost 1 AP, you can do some limited amount of negligible things like talking for free.\nTerminology will change to be more clear. Categories will change.\nTable Deck: The deck of cards that the DM (or whoever) draws from during initiative. The deck that the whole table uses.\nTable Discard: The discard pile for the whole table.\nTable Cards: Each character’s personal set of cards that they add to the table deck when initiative starts.\nHand: The cards that you have been dealt and are holding on to.\nDiscard/Pay/Spend: Cards that have been used or removed that go to the discard and are shuffled together next round to make the table deck.\nTrashed/Removed: Cards that have been used or removed and do not get shuffled back in every round.\nTrash: The trash pile for the whole table.\nBy “default” every character has 3 identical cards. The cards say “1 AP” and indicate what character they belong to.\nWhen initiative starts all characters pass their table sets to the DM. The DM shuffles them together. The DM pulls a card from the top of the deck and deals the card to the character/player that it belongs to. When a character is dealt a card they can choose to act, spending however many cards they want to. They can also just hold on to the card. Cards that are not spent by the end of the round are discarded and shuffled back in.\nIf you want to act, speak up before the DM moves on!\nYou can spend 1 AP at any time to act immediately.\nYou can only have 6 cards in the table deck at a time.\n\nMultiple->AP->Costs\nSome types of actions also have multiple AP costs. The first time you do the thing in a round it costs the first amount, the second time it costs the second, etc. These costs are connected with arrows, like this: 1->2->3.\n\nAP Shenanigans: Temp AP, Losing AP, Gaining AP, the “Wait” action\n“Temp AP” must be spend in the same round it is recieved. If you do nothing for a round, regain 1 AP from the trash (if you have lost any).\n\n\n\n“Beginning of the Round”\nSometimes the particular order things happen in the “beginning of the round” will matter. In that case, they resolve in this order.\n\n1. Effect Managment\nAny already active effects that trigger “at the beginning of a round” happen first. They happen before anything else in the round does. Examples includes taking damage from [poison] or [bleed] or gaining health from [heal]. If you have an effect active that causes you to do some sort of roll or contest, do that now.\n\n\n2. Status Management\nStatuses are added or removed now. A point of [poison] is removed, a point of [heal] is removed, anything that would end at the “beginning” of this round ends now.\n\n\n\n3. Skills\nSome moves and skills can be used “at the beginning of the round”. These must be used after effects and statuses resolve. They happen at the beginning of this “Main Phase”.\nThe main phase is where cards are drawn an actions are performed."

    "section": "SOCIAL Rolls",
    "text": "SOCIAL Rolls\nNow for the least important part of playing a TTRPG, interacting with other people. This system is designed to allow a characters skills and stats to augment their social actions. The emphasis is not on getting good rolls, but on saying or doing the right thing. Rolls are used to express a particular character’s social talents, but they don’t replace the content of what the character says or does.\nA GM can use a check to determine success if they really do not know whether a given social action should or shouldn’t work on some character, and neither a success nor failure would be especially interesting. Even in this case, difficulty should be determined contextually. Grading numerical difficulty for a social interaction is generally difficult. A GM cannot prepare beforehand for the things a player will do or say, so DCs have to be set on the fly. Sometimes they are set incorrectly or something breaks. In this case, ignore the system/roll and do whatever is the most sensible/interesting/funny.\nSocial skills are divided into two sets: communicative skills and perceptive skills. communicative skills include persuasion, deception, and performance. Perceptive skills include sensing motives, detecting deceit, and gaining insight into another character’s emotional state.\n\nCommunicative Skills, Bias, and Reputation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n6\nRevered\nYou are seen as almost otherwordly, beyond reproach.\n\n\n5\nLoved\nYou are set apart from others, distinctly trustworthy, valued, and important.\n\n\n4\nAdmired\nYou are seen as an example to be followed, people will give your words great weight. They will go out of their way to help you out.\n\n\n3\nTrusted\nYou are trusted and valued. People will go out of their way to help you.\n\n\n2\nWell-Liked\nYou are liked quite a bit. People are willing to help you out. They want to see you do well.\n\n\n1\nLiked\nYou are liked. People want to talk and barter.\n\n\n0\nNeutral\nPeople don’t think much of you one way or another. They have the time to talk.\n\n\n-1\nDisliked\nPeople will give you bad deals in trade. They do not particularly want to talk to you. They do not want to barter.\n\n\n-2\nStrongly Disliked\nPeople do not want to talk or trade. They want you to go away.\n\n\n-3\nLoathed\nYou are a pariah. A group might throw you in jail, an individual might do you harm opportunistically. People will actively try to get rid of you.\n\n\n-4\nHated\nYou will be attacked. If someone is attacking you, they will be given help.\n\n\n-5\nDespised\nYou will be attacked on sight. There is probably a bounty on your head.\n\n\n-6\nReviled\nYou are vilified and reviled. Your name, face, and terrible actions are known. A group will send paid assassins and soldiers after you. An individual will go to great lengths and take on great risk and personal cost in order to do as much harm as possible to you.\n\n\n\nThe framework for setting a DC for a given social roll and the framework for reputation management are the same and they can be used in combination. Both systems share the same table of scores with rough characterizations of what each score “feels” like.\nThe scores range from -6 (“Reviled”) to +6 (“Revered”). These scores can be used by a GM to easily keep track of relationships and attitudes. They are also mechanical modifiers. If a character is at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”) with some group or individual, you treat their social roll as lowered by 2 (or you can just raise the DC by 2).\nYou can use these scores to set a sort of “default” attitude or bias for NPCs. The kindly innkeeper in a small peaceful town might treat every new person at around +2 (“Well-Liked”). The sneering guards in front of a keep might treat everyone at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”). Another traveler on the road just trying to get to where they’re going might be at -1 (“Disliked”) just because they really don’t want to stop and chat. The same traveler might, if you help them out, switch to +1 (“Liked”).\nThe purpose of social rolls is to be able to, in a given interaction, change the way people perceive you or interact with you. Remember that rolling checks with the SOCIAL score does not replace the content of what a character does or says, but just augments it. If a player passes the DC, treat their interaction as happening at 1 point higher than it would be otherwise. If the player exceeds the DC by more than 3, you can treat the interaction as being at 2 points higher than it would be otherwise.\nSay a player character is in a town in which they are at -3 (“Loathed”). Typically, this would mean that they are treated as a pariah, people are unwilling to talk to them and will actively attempt to get rid of them, they might be thrown in jail on made up charges. Guards will not come to their aid. If they are very charismatic they may be able to walk into a shop, attempt to talk the owner into selling them something and succeed by 4 on a roll. The shop owner thinks that the player character really doesn’t seem quite so bad, he thinks that maybe he is misremembering something or getting this person confused with someone else. He is still wary, however. He still treats the character as -1 or “Disliked”, he will tend not to want to barter, and he’ll want to get through the interaction quickly. Similarly, a guard treating everyone at -2 might be persuaded to relax a bit and just talk to the player character on neutral terms (-2 -> 0).\nOf course, there are plenty of things besides social interaction that might raise or lower someone’s opinion of you, and if the content of what a player character said is something that another character would naturally agree with or go along with, then no roll is necessary. Remember that the good will from one positive social interaction does not last forever. Actions will tend to have a greater effect for longer than words. If you just stabbed someone, you are not going to be able to smooth that over with your wit and charm, you do not even get to roll.\nThe table with specific characterizations is useful, but it can be boiled down to some rules of thumb. 0 is neutral. From +1 to +3 the character is favored. Persuasion, information gathering, and bartering will be easier. People give you the benefit of the doubt. From +3 to +6 people will go out of their way to help you, they will likely come to your aid in combat or follow you into combat. From -1 to -3 people dislike you and generally do not want to have anything to do with you. -4 to -6 is when you start seeing a lot of unprovoked violence.\nThis framework is largely for the benefit of the GM, to allow them to easily keep track of attitudes and relationships and to quickly create DCs and resolve rolls in a way that rewards the skills of the player as well as the skills of the character.\nThere are several different ways a GM can deal with this system in game. The system can be player-facing, that is to say, you could tell your players their numerical reputation among different groups or numerical values for the attitudes of various characters (along with descriptions). I do not recommend this. You could gate numerical information behind something like a good insight roll. This is fine, but even in this case you should lean on qualitative descriptions of how some character treats a player character. You can also keep the entire system completely to yourself, as a useful tool for the GM to structure descriptions and interactions. In this approach players do not get to actually know numerical values and you never have to reveal or justify movements in numerical values. This is probably your best bet. In this case the framework is still useful for figuring out how much the charisma of the character has helped the efforts of the player.\n\n\nSocial Perception\n“Social perception” is used here to refer to skills that allow you to roll to sense motives, detect deceit, and gain insight into another character’s emotional state. It’s important here to establish when exactly these skills are used and checks are made.\nWhen a player asks a question that would fall under “social perception” about another character, they should first be given a superficial description of the character and their apparent emotional state. If the character in question seems to be at ease, the GM should just say so. This is true even if the character in question is only pretending to be at ease, but plans to attack or betray the player’s character. It does not take a roll to be told that someone yelling and brandishing a knife is probably somewhat unhappy. The rules and skills for social perception are not meant to cover the superficial. These rules are for attempts to read another character. Social perception rolls are very similar to other character conflicts, they can be either a check or a contest.\n\n\nSocial Checks\nWhen the roll is a check, the DC will likely be a default DC of 6 + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills). If you are trying to read a character who is is lying the DC will be set by their initial attempt to lie, which will have been a check + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills) against your passive social perception. If they attempt to lie and fail this check, then whatever they said will be described as highly suspicious or likely a lie. If they succeed in their initial check, but you pass their DC when you attempt to read them, you will notice that something seems wrong, or suspicious, or you’ll notice strange nervous habits.\nSocial perception rolls are almost always checks. If you are lying to someone, you perform a check. If they are trying to figure out if you are lying, they perform a check. If someone is trying to convince you of something and you think they might be lying, you perform a check.\n\nSocial Check Resolution\nIn the case of a tie, resolution is the same as any other check. Defender wins. Otherwise there are four possible outcomes.\nIf you pass the check more than 3, Complete Success:\nYou read the defender like an open book. You get a full answer to whatever question you were asking, or as full an answer as you could get from watching someone. They crumble at your gaze. Maybe they are so caught off guard that they fumble and make an embarrassing mistake, mentioning something they should not have.\nIf you pass the check by 3 or less, Moderate Success:\nYou get some insight into the question you were asking. If you are trying to see if someone is lying, you’ll know that they’re certainly not telling the whole truth, that they are actively misleading you. If you’re trying to get insight into someone’s emotional state, you get a good idea of how they are feeling. You might be able to tell that someone is distressed and trying to hide it. This is a pretty good read of someone, and they do not know that you know anything.\nIf you fail the check by 3 or less, Moderate Failure:\nYou have no answer to your question at all and the person you were attempting to read knows the vague shape of the question you asked or that you have a question. If you were trying to figure out if someone was lying about a specific claim they might know that you don’t trust them or that you suspect them in some way. Otherwise, you might just be staring and it’s weird.\nIf you fail the check by more than 3, Catastrophic Failure:\nGod have mercy on your soul. You completely give yourself away, your interests and your question are written all over your face. If you are trying to catch a lie, not only is it clear what exactly you think is being lied about, it’s clear that you have no idea if the defender is lying. Maybe you scoffed at a specific claim, maybe you blurt out “But the stone of Macguffin!” at exactly the wrong time. Your face is very red.\n\n\n\nContests\nContests are far rarer than checks. Social perception contests happen in contexts where it is understood that both parties are trying to advance their own interests and, if not outright lying, being very selective with the truth. Some examples of this would be a tense negotiation, an official dinner of ambassadors whose states are on the brink of war, a game of poker, spies meeting to trade secrets while not revealing their true intentions. In these cases checks would be happening simultaneously anyway, and the information that someone might doubt what you are saying or that they might not be telling the whole truth wouldn’t be very meaningful.\nContest Resolution is just about the same as check resolution. The difference between the rolls of the two characters determines which character succeeds and which fails, and to what degree. This success and failure are captured by the same event. For example one character might give away information they shouldn’t have, which captures both the success of one character and the failure of another.\nTies are just ties, a staredown, a tense silence. If your group prefers, ties can be resolved in the normal way for a contest: win goes to the higher modifier, if that’s a tie, it’s a tie in game, if that makes no sense, do it again."

If you would do 1 damage you cannot wield the weapon.\n\n\n\nIf you’re 2 STR above the requirements for a [two-handed] weapon, you can effectively wield it with one hand. If you use two hands on a [one-handed] weapon, raise your effective STR with the weapon by 2.\n\n\n\nFor every point you are below requirements for the weapon, halve the range. Throwing a spear or dagger costs 2 AP, uses PER(CEPTION) to hit, has no damage scaling, 3 + AGI spaces for range. It does half damage rounded up when thrown."

    "text": "Injury and Death\nThis part consistently needs reworking.\n\nInjury\nInjuries are unique conditions that typically come with crit damage. Injuries are removed when the character reaches full crit health.\n\n\nDying Instantly or Being Stabilized\nIf you are reduced to -(Max HP/2) you die instantly.\nIf your HP is brought above 0, you are stabilized. If you are stabilized but you haven’t reached 6 HP, rest (rolling recovery dice) until you reach 6 HP. If you’re brought back to 6 HP or more, regain consciousness.\n\nBeing Reduced to 0 HP, Being “Downed”\nYou can have negative HP. You can also stabilize even with negative HP, but you have to reach 6 HP before you regain consciousness.\nWhen a player is reduced to 0 but not killed, they are “down” and they are unconscious. If they are not stabilized, they are unable to take any sort of action besides rolling death checks. They are [vulnerable].\nWhen a player is downed the DM sets a death DC by rolling 2d6 with no modifiers. The DM does not tell the player the DC.\nOn the turn a player is downed and on every subsequent turn, the player rolls a death check and tells the DM their roll. If their roll matches or passes the DC it’s a success. If the roll is below the DC, it’s a failure. If the roll is a failure, the DM notes by how much the roll failed, DC - roll. This difference will be used to determine the consequence of the failure using the consequence table. Don’t make any extra rolls to resolve consequences at this point as other characters might use medicine to improve the outcome, skills might be triggered, etc. Consequences are only resolved if/when the character survives.\n3 successes means the character stabilizes at their current HP. 3 failures means they die.\nOnce they either hit 3 successes or 3 failures, the DM tells them to stop rolling. They are not told whether they died or not or what consequences they might have. They only find out once someone goes to check on their character.\nIf you’re hit while you’re down, take the damage and add a failed death check.\n\n\n\nConsequence Tables\nWhy is this called Consequence Tables? The idea was that there could be multiple tables for different areas, contexts, game tones, etc.\n\n\n\nFailure\nConsequence\n\n\n\n\n-1\n[weak] (1 Hour)\n\n\n-2\n[weak] (8 Hours)\n\n\n-3\nScars, [frail] (8 Hours),\n\n\n-4\nScars, [frail] (1 Day), Lower 1 Stat\n\n\n-5\nScars, [frail] (2 Days), Lower 1 Stat\n\n\n-6, -7\nScars, Lame\n\n\n-8, -9, -10\nLose a Limb\n\n\n\n\nConsequences\n[weak]\n-1 STR, -1 CON, -2 to Defense\n[frail]\n-1 STR, -2 CON, -1 AGI, -3 to Defense\nScars\nScars are completely cosmetic and up to DM discretion. The scar might be from the blow that downed the character or they might be from some other large blow received in the same fight.\nLower a Stat\nLower a stat by 1 by rolling a d4 using the following table:\n\n\n\nStat\nRoll\n\n\n\n\nSTR\n1\n\n\nAGI\n2\n\n\nDEX\n3\n\n\nCON\n4\n\n\n\nLame\nTake your first move action as normal.

    "text": "Encumbrance and Rations\nEncumbrance is measured in encs. Encs are a combined measure of weight and unwieldiness. Most weapons are 1 enc. A [heavy] weapon is 2 encs. A days worth of food and water is 1. 3 small items, like a book, a dagger, and some bandages together take 1 enc. Negligible items like quills and needles don’t take up any encs, unless the DM determines you are carrying “way too many”.\nPlayers must describe and account for how they are moving their things. They take “reasonable” penalties for impractical methods. If they tie a bunch of swords together and then hang that off of their neck, they will have a hard time stealthing. If they fall over while wearing the described necklace of dangerous wind chimes they’re going to have a bad time.\n\nStorage Spaces, The “Personal” Space and Bags\n“Storage space” is used to broadly refer to any place you can put things. Each storage space you have can be thought of as a source of a max encumbrance and a source of an [encumbered] threshold. Most of the time you will have two storage spaces:\n\nYour “personal” space, which includes anything you’re carrying that isn’t itself a storage space. Most often this would be your weapons and armor.\nYour bag. This is most often some kind of backpack.\n\nYou have a personal [encumbered] threshold. This is used for the weapons and armor you are carrying without a bag. Your personal [encumbered] threshold is 3 + STR. Your personal max encumbrance is 6 + STR encs.\nThe primary use of a bag is to give you more [encumbered] thresholds and to change your maximum encumbrance.\nBags have varying [encumbered] thresholds and max encumbrances. If a bag does not say it has an [encumbrance] threshold, then it never makes you [encumbered]. This is common for small bags that don’t have a max encumbrance high enough to be able to encumber, or bags that are designed not to encumber.\nRemoving a bag is 2 AP.\nSearching a bag is 2 AP.\n\n\nThe [encumbered] Threshold and Maximum Encumbrance\nIf you are past any encumbrance threshold in any storage space, you are [encumbered], you have the [encumbered] status.\nThe [encumbered] status lowers your move speed by 1. Your Defense is lowered by 3. Additionally, take a -1 to all AGI checks.\nIf you aren’t wearing heavy armor but you’re carrying enough in your bag to pass the bag’s encumbrance threshold, you are [encumbered]. Less obviously, this also means that if you are past your personal encumbrance threshold (most likely from carrying weapons and wearing armor that are too heavy for you to move freely with) but you are not past your [encumbered] threshold for your bag, you are still [encumbered].\nIn order to avoid passing an [encumbered] threshold you likely want to spread the weight around multiple storage spaces, keeping under all of their [encumbered] thresholds, or you might want to just put everything in a bag so that in a fight you can take it off quickly and not be [encumbered].\nYou cannot carry more encs in total than your single highest max encumbrance score. This does not mean that having one storage space where you can carry 8 encs means that you must be able to carry 8 encs in every storage space, it just means that all together you can’t carry more than 8 encs.\nUnless otherwise specified, you can only use one bag at a time. If some mechanic allows you to use multiple bags, you cannot carry in total more than your highest max encumbrance from a single source, though you can move encs around to try to avoid the [encumbered] status effect.\nYour [encumbered] threshold and your maximum encumbrance can be affected by status effects or skills, but most often they will be affected by the bag you are using."

The first is the alchemically active SALT found deep in the earth or in the End (this is used as a magical resource, so to avoid confusion it’s written in all caps, “SALT”). The second is any adulterated form of the first, including the sort of salt used in cooking. Alchemical SALT can be transformed into a much larger amount of conventional salt, or it might be used to fuel some spell. SALT is the most common currency in the End and especially underground. SALT is measured in “flakes” denoted “f”. 1 full unit of SALT used in casting is equivalent in mass to 100f. SALT when ingested and used as a casting resource is like [poison] or [bleed], it’s a status effect tracked by tokens. Sometimes this is notated as [SALT]. [SALT] naturally wears off at the rate of 1 [SALT] per hour. Having [SALT] equal to or greater than 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn causes you to take 20 damage.\n\n\nThere are two common ways to use [SALT], “burning” over a long period, typically an hour, and “flaring”, or spending a lot of [SALT] in a short period for a larger effect. Flaring lasts anywhere from a single move to several hours depending on the ability. Burning and flaring both cost about 1-3 [SALT], typically. Anyone can learn to burn [SALT] though doing so is dangerous.\n\n\n\nIf your [SALT] is above 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn, take 6 damage and lose 1 [SALT].\nThe total amount of [SALT] you are burning and flaring at any one time cannot exceed your HYLIC score (though your [SALT] itself can exceed your HYLIC).\nWhile you are burning [SALT] for an ability, that [SALT] still counts towards your total [SALT]. If you choose to shut off an ability before it would naturally go away, the ability ends, but the [SALT] still has to go away naturally."

G maps to K and D to T, as those distinctions are not found in written Loric. C represents the extremely rare optional explicit “null vowel” letter. ’ is the character you have to put after a consonant to indicate its vowel was implicit, and if followed by another of the same letter, should not be interpreted as geminate. _ is reserved for internal use, and is forbidden to occur in your input texts. In cursive mode, if you type an invalid sequence of vowels and consonants, this will result in an invalid input indicator. Compositional straightive, and decompositional cursive, (two later & eccentric innovations of Loric printing presses) remain unimplemented here. Stacked dashes are unimplemented, but the rest of the punctuation is implemented—with fairly arbitrary ascii characters for many of them. Not all of the conventions of this project would seem idiomatic to a Loric speaker. If you don’t have lettermapping.css in this directory, run ./make-css-classes > lettermapping.css in this directory to generate it.\n\n\nWriting style:  cursive  straightive   unlinated straightive"
