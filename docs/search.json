    "text": "why are the rules the way they are\n\nthis was re: the very cooked tactile weapon system\n\nWhy use this system?\nSay you have a character who gets some bonus with axes and hammers, this expresses that you’re a strong character who does overwhelming strikes with heavy STR-based weapons, you’re not some sort of saber duelist. Do you get advantage with a warhammer? What if you’re trying to use the pick side of a warhammer? Using the pick is the same motion as using the hammer, and its the same weapon, so shouldn’t you get the same bonus? Doesn’t it follow, then, that you should get the same bonus with warpicks? What if you find a sword with a forward curving blade so dramatic that the sword is basically just an axe with a hilt? Shouldn’t you get your axe bonus with that? This is without getting into the migraine that is “pole weapons” (poleaxe, bill, partizan, halberd, bardiche, glaive, pike…). This system allows us to neatly avoid the question of what weapon or what attack is axe-like or spear-like in some context or another and it allows us to avoid having a rigid taxonomy of weapons all while still engaging with the different advantages or features of different weapons. It also lets us create all sorts of goofy fantasy weapons without having to quickly change the taxonomy, all we do is describe how the fantasy weapon is built and the attacks you do with it and the weapon will work with existing skills and characters.\nIn this system we just describe the weapon itself and some basic qualities about the attack. A particular poleaxe is just a [two-handed] [shafted] weapon with [reach: 1-3] a particular Speed and To-Hit, and a couple moves. Maybe it has an axe head, a pick, and a spear. So it has a (P) [thrusting] attack, an (S) [swinging: leading] and a (P) [swinging: leading]. Maybe you have skills that work very well with axes, but you expect that this sort of multi-use weapon with a lot of reach might come in handy for hunting down a specific type of monster. You might choose then to take this pole-weapon with a relatively better (S) [swinging: leading] attack so you can leverage the axe-related skills you already have. This also helps us express skill transfer from different types of weapons. Your character is very good at two-handed axes and you find a one-handed axe that is really useful in some situations, maybe it applies some particular status effect. There’s going to be a lot of skill overlap, you just won’t get anything that requires [two-handed]. That’s all there is to it.\n\n\n\nA Case for Encumbrance, Rations, etc.\nLogistical rules for encumbrance, rations, etc. have a bad reputation. Often they feel like meaningless and slow bookkeeping. These rules are meant to be light enough that they should not slow the game down, but I want quickly go over why these rules are worth having in the first place.\nThese rules force players to make decisions about what they’re going to take with them and what they’re going to prepare for. Players and NPCs are very close to one another in HP and damage output in this game. The way you get an edge on someone else in combat is figuring out what your best option is given what you’ve prepared and the resources you have. The strength of most items and abilities are contextual, but this won’t matter or make the game more interesting if you can carry around a tool for every context.\nEncumbrance rules also add depth outside of combat. When trading with someone on the road, you have to trade with something you brought. If you’re delivering something to someone or hiding something, you have to keep it somewhere. These logistical questions should cause you to engage with the world like it’s a real place and make decisions about what you want to take with you and what you want to leave, what is important to your character and why. If your character is a rugged outlander that knows how to survive in the wilderness, you have an important role in the party, you’re the reason the party is able to pack light and travel quickly, you’re the reason that the party can survive at all when you run out of rations. There are many more opportunities for non-combat character decisions to be important.\nAll of this allows different weapons, items, and characters to shine in different contexts. This encourages different people in the party to take up different roles, acquire skills, and character adapts to situations they find themselves in."

    "text": "All poasts are my own opinion and preference and as such are infallible and perfect.\nEvery mechanic and every rule introduced to a game imposes a cost. The game becomes heavier. Everything you do now has more friction. You’re in a tense fight, you duck behind a crate and shoot at your assailants. Someone half-remembers a rule about half cover, or maybe this counts as full cover, how tall is this crate exactly? Someone else remembers that there is a rule about shooting from behind cover and anyway can you really take cover twice in a move? Shouldn’t you just shoot and then take cover? Or do you count as “in-cover” the entire time? And so it begins. The rulebooks come out. Your cool move that seemed totally reasonable as part of the fiction is now being deliberated by the Supreme Court.\nI’m told that once everyone has spent long enough with a system everything really starts moving smoothly. That sounds plausible but more often it seems that everyone remembers slightly different versions of the same rule, or at least two people disagree and the rulebooks come out anyway. Often tables end up just making something up that makes more sense contextually anyway. People who didn’t even know the rule existed would have done something that made sense contextually and moved on.\nObviously games like this need rules but rules should help the game more than they hurt. That requirement should be enforced for every rule, especially small ones. Every rule should be simultaneously as modular and as load-bearing as possible. If a whole set of rules can be replaced by a framework or rule of thumb without hurting the game, even better. There are many ways of doing this. Advantage, disadvantage, adding a score, whatever.\nSystems and rulesets in this game often look very similar and use the same minimal set of mechanics in order to try to and achieve this. They often cover a very broad set of situations. This should make it easy for a table to make up another rule on the fly that will work just fine with everything else. This is also why numbers in the system tend to stay small, every point should ideally feel meaningful. The shape of the 2d6 probability curve is very useful for making small bonuses meaningful, especially small differences in bonuses. But that’s for another post.\nI’m not going to talk about making good rules here because I’ve never made one. All I want to do here is explain my general dislike of single-purpose and specific rules, which is why try to avoid overly specific rules for specific situations. Sometimes this is hard to avoid. There is a rule for attempting to use two hands for a weapon that is [one-handed]. That is not all that dissimilar from cover, half-cover, or shooting from cover. Likely I will end up having to cut, add, change rules like that so that they won’t get in the way.\nI think the use of small rigid rules over broad reusable frameworks tends to shape the game into one that is built around the small rules too much. These rules corall players into coloring within the lines, thinking that the available options are only what there are rules for and not engaging with the actual place and world of the ttrpg. By overspecifying small things the tactility of the world is undermined. This is my attempt to find some set of rules that should only ever encourage players to engage with the tactile detail of the world.\nIt’s about the rules you don’t write, maaan."

It would be unreasonable to treat that character’s TECH score as 0 given that they’ve never even seen a computer. They should treat TECH as a [special] score or have a very negative score in TECH, say -5 (expressing that it would take them a good deal of work to get to the point where they can even begin to interact with technology). There is no rule that expresses this. It is expected that if you mix settings and mechanics in this way you will have some edge cases to iron out and you will have to make up some rules on the fly.

You can also just use summation notation (Σn).\n\n\nSome Basic Statistics for Making Your Own Randomized Character Creation Rolls\nAt a glance it might seem like d6-3 and d4-2 should be equally good. The expected value of a d6 is 3.5, so 3.5 - 3 = 0.5. EV of a d4 is 2.5, 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 as well, so why is d6-3 twice as good as d4-2?\nGetting to 2 in a score costs 3 SP (1 + 2), but getting to 3 costs 6 SP (1 + 2 + 3). Crucially, raising your score from a negative number always costs 1 SP, so if you roll a 1 on d6-3, you end up with -2, which is only equivalent to getting -2 SP (that is, you only have to spend 2 more SP than if you never bothered rolling at all) but if you roll a 6, you get a score of 3 which is worth 6 SP. High rolls are a lot more rewarding than low rolls are punishing at character creation.\nIf you want to figure out your own randomization schemes (that involve a single die) and what their equivalent average SP value is, doing so is relatively simple. First, you figure out all of the possible rolls. For d6-3, these rolls are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 (a roll of 1 - 3 = -2, etc.). Then find the “values” or SP you would have to spend to get that score for the rolls. For d6-3 these are -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 6. To get the average value, just add up all the SP values and divide by the number of rolls (because all of the rolls will be equally likely). In the case of d6-3, you get 1.5. Finally, multiply the per-roll-SP-value you just found by the number of scores you’re rolling for to see the equivalent SP.\nRemember that randomization means PCs will end up with characters whose scores are “worth” different amounts of SP. Finally, consider giving players some points specifically to buy skills with. Or don’t!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Any scores not listed for a character are treated as being at 0. This has worked fine for humanoid characters but it quickly breaks down for a horse. A horse doesn’t have many relevant scores so the reasonable and quick way to create a horse NPC would be to just list movement speed and maybe STR. Of course, this means that the horse has as much DEX as a normal person. Horses do not have thumbs, they don’t even have fingers. There’s a problem here.\nThere are a couple ways of dealing with this.\n\nGroup-Relative Scores\nMaybe a 0 here means that the horse is only as DEXtrous as any other horse. This isn’t too inelegant. Unfortunately, this is not how scores work anywhere else in the game. They are used in contests, so a 1 DEX mod should mean basically the same thing no matter who has it. Contests are not graded on a curve. This does not work.\nThis failed rule does gesture at another issue though. What it means for a horse to be agile will be different from what it means for a person to be agile. If we grant that the base score system is on a human scale, how agile is a horse on that same scale? Is that a meaningful question?\n\n\n“Simple” NPCs\nMaybe a [simple] tag could be added to some NPCs. The score of any non-listed score for one of these NPCs could be considered -3, or automatic failure. Of course the problem here is that now one has to specify every score that might come up in a way that violates the goal of modularity. Also, it sucks. Surely the horse has more than -3 CON right? Maybe for an NPC that is simple enough this won’t be an issue, a horse can’t be expected to have a TECHNOLOGY score or whatever.\nThis isn’t a rule that contributes to the game and fits in nicely with the rest of the rules. It’s just a rule for the sake of having a rule.\n\n\nPreferring Not To\nRules are bad. An edge case like this should prompt one to reexamine the ruleset in question. If there is an elegant intuitive change that would make the rules more useful and expressive, then that change should be made. If there is a small rule or condition that fixes the edge case, rounds the rules out, and gives players some more options, then that rule should be put in place. Neither of those things seem true.\nWe could make people check more boxes when creating entities. Every score could come with a set of requirements. NPCs can be jammed into a typology where each type has slightly different rules and mechanics. When faced with ambiguity you can refer to rules for what a certain score means in a certain context in order to execute a predictable algorithm. This sounds miserable.\nI call this DEX-rolling horse an edge case, but am I right about that? Yes. Is this really an edge case? Yes. There may be plenty of settings with lots of horses, but why would a horse be rolling a DEX check? How would you plan for that beforehand when creating the horse NPC? If you’re in a prison cell trying to get your tied up horse to quietly grab the keys and toss them to you, friend you’re in an edge case. The inconsistency that the original rule causes seems to demand a fix, a new rule. But I would prefer not to. Just play the game, either the horse can’t make the DEX check or you just make up something that lines up with the tone of your game, it’s fine.\nIf you need more of a framework, the score is probably between 0 and -3 for this sort of thing. You could have the check made with one die. In a more serious game the horse just cannot make a DEX check. In a more goofy game the horse might make its first DEX check at -3, immediately roll two sixes, pickpocket the key from the guard with his tongue and now you’ve got a 2 DEX thiefhorse with a circus-related backstory and a quest for revenge against a clown named Bilphus.

As the interaction progresses it will insist that the subject take certain forms and pens, filling out the forms, recording and reporting their actions, submitting the forms. It will insist that, to better make sure the forms are tracked and kept safe, the subject must allow the creature to attach the form directly with a small pin. Just a small note to be attached with a small pin, a convenient magic that allows the subject to never misplace the form.\nThe more information a subject gives and the more a subject engages, the more power the Bureau has over the subject. The Receptionist might first appear when the character is weak or in need, offering a service, information, or healing. It never specifies what it wants in return, if asked it will give a long explanation about how the service is not only free but it also entitles you to unspecified future services, advantages, and “opportunities”. If pressed it might admit that yes there could be some minor service fees but these are merely a formality, they can be waived or some arrangement could be found.\nThe Receptionist is after two things, information and some reason to be involved. It wants the subject to be visible, registered, quantified. It wants a confirmation of some instance in which the subject was wronged or perhaps wronged another. It wants the subject to accept some aid from the Bureau or accept some deal with the Bureau. The Receptionist is almost always the first member of the Bureau that any given character meets.\n\n\nOther Mechanisms\nWhen faced with a Receptionist the best move is to say nothing and kill it where it sits. This will make an enemy of the faction unless it is done from stealth or in some other way they do not see or cannot understand.\nThey cannot see art, it is literally invisible to them, its effects unknowable. Because of this it is not uncommon for illiterate travelers to carry books of poetry in order to beat to death Bureaucrats that appear in front of them.\nThe body of a Bureaucrat is good as a source of cheap ink and kindling."

They cling under branches and flatten their baggy bodies against walls. They prepare to ambush any shape passing by.\nThey are as barely functional in water as they are on land. What their awkward and spasmodic movement excels at is propelling them through mud. Their lapses into atonal jibbering make coherent thought, and seemingly magic, very difficult. The superstitious believe them to harbor some deep well of cryptic knowledge that they presumably cultivate when not clubbing each other or being eaten by the giant eyeless catfish that also live in the mud.\nOne of the only formal records of their behavior comes from S. Bevlins, a scholar intrigued by stories of their mystical abilities. After weeks spent in careful hidden observation of constant slapstick inanity, Bevlins observed an elaborately painted Tchok pick up a stick and stumble around dragging it through the mud, creating a complex symmetrical pattern before realizing he couldn’t find his way out of it. The Tchok then angrily beat the lines in the mud with his stick, losing his grip and flinging the stick outside of the pattern.

They must always stay awake, SALT buildup would kill them in their sleep. The solution to the exhaustion and mental toll of their sleeplessness is burning more SALT. This abuse of SALT wears them down mentally and physically, a side effect that can only really be addressed with, of course, even more SALT. Their dependence on SALT tends to outpace their production, and they live in a frantic search for more.\nTheir fingers are sharp clumsy daggers of salt. Their limited hand mobility makes them poor with most weapons. When they fight, the increased production of salt armor covers and envelopes their hands, so they fight “unarmed”, with enormous spiked fists made of salt. In combat most are terrifying incoherently screaming superhuman brawlers in grinding mineral plate armor. Some rare crust punks can burn their salt by moving very quickly, cutting with enormous katars fused to their closed fist during combat. They cannot use armor, it just constrains their natural shifting salt armor.\nSome crust punks are miners who rejected a life of toil, preferring a short brutal life of glorious combat. It’s common for powerful or sloppy crust punks to die crystallized by their own continuous salt production, leaving behind a sparkling statue.\n\nGameplay Note\nPlayers might be able to learn unarmed techniques (including with brass knuckles, push-daggers) and improved physical augmentation through salt from them, but more likely they’re going to get jumped by a bunch of crust punks who beat them and take their SALT."

    "text": "The Isopods are an ancient people with courts, politics, philosophy, and dynasties. They can communicate through writing and speech. They can bypass language entirely to communicate complex feelings and even full thoughts directly to one another via pheromones. They do this instinctively, like a person moves their face.\nThe Isopod word for what we would call thought is approximately “inner thought” where pheromones are “outer thought”. Their word for themselves is approximately “thinker”, whereas their words for other groups relate the members of those groups to objects.\nIn the ornate and ancient Isopod courts, richly painted Isopods attempt to subtly manipulate each other by precisely deploying pheromones, even using bottled pheromones to mislead and persuade. They might strategically steer the mood of a room through highly trained covert manipulators though an Isopod gentleman would never admit this.\nIsopods view life in the caves as beautiful, ancient, and harmonious. In the caves their pheromones are not tossed to the wind as on the surface. It seems natural and just, then, that the underground should be so vast and varied where the surface is merely the end of useful space. They believe the world must be a sphere, as a sphere would maximize underground volume while minimizing surface area. They find it tremendously convenient that when a form of life is meant to be eaten they generally have their hard structure on the inside which could only serve the purpose of making them more suitable as food. They see their ability to speak to lower life as a great convenience, like being able to order around your coat rack. They are not a religious group generally, so a question their philosophers must grapple with is “Why, if there is no God, is the world so just?”\nIsopods also have philosophy on the nature of being and consciousness. They hold that, because they can directly communicate and transfer thoughts and emotions, they can verify and understand the experience and the consciousness of other Isopods. Groups that do not have this ability cannot meaningfully be said to be conscious. Most isopods think of mammals and similar as a sort of automata, not capable of any true thought or complex socialization. They are not generally hostile or even rude to mammals. To mistreat a lower life form would not be immoral per se, but it would be tremendously gauche. If you tell an Isopod your name, say “Tod” and it has reason to remember your name, it may refer to you as “It Calls Itself Tod”, though this is typically shortened to “itsa Tod”.\nIsopods converse in great halls built into the cave along the ceiling and on the walls as well as on the floor.\nIsopods once ruled the earth and they believe their time will come again. They are one of the oldest forms of life, persisting largely unchanged through time.\nThey have mixed views on other bugs, depending on their ability to communicate.\nThey absolutely revile the ants and would see them exterminated. They read what primitive “pheromones” the ants create as a sort of repugnant malignancy below the level of thought. Their hate and fear is magnified by the growing numbers of the ants."

Each appendage ends in two articulated long sticky fingers. The two front pairs of appendages are the longest, with long fingers meant for fine manipulation. Lacking thumbs, the Isopods use their arms in vertical pairs with the two suspended top fingers and two suspended bottom fingers working in tandem, each finger opposable. The appendages after the foremost pairs become shorter and their main purpose shifts from manipulation to movement. They move low, using all of the limbs that line their body. They move parallel to the ground, with the bulk of their limbs folded under them. Isopods are larger than humans, though of course they are shorter when walking. They do not call their movement “crawling”.\nThey will tip their front portions upward in only a couple of situations. The first is when engaged in some especially demanding manual task where lifting something in front of themselves using only a couple of limb pairs will not suffice, as in the use of most of their instruments. The second is when in a posture of deference or trust.\nThey fight primarily through quickly throwing out rope darts or barbed blades with their long powerful fore-limbs and then either retracting the projectiles or attaching the ropes to the surfaces of the cave, suspending their victim from multiple points. They do this while moving rapidly along the cave walls. They employ long specialized patas and katars in close combat. They use nets to slow down their enemies."

Its shapes are highly varied, the colony that comprises its body improvised out of the bodies of found, slain, caught, or purchased creatures. It can be a mindless mass of claws or a giant psychic centipede of cobbled together human limbs and faces. Its entire body is a fungal colony.\nTo create a Legion, roll d20s. Decide beforehand how many Legions you want and of what size.\nFor every d20 rolled in its creation, the Legion gains a size category. 1: small. 2: medium, 4: large, 6: giant.\nEverytime the d20 lands on 20, raise the Legions intelligence.\n0: As a stupid rabid chimp.\n1: Single words, sentence fragments.\n2: It speaks as an intelligent hivemind, pulling information, preferences, and memories from the intelligent creatures it has consumed. It flits between personalities during conversation.\n3: It is hyper-intelligent, capable of inscrutable magic, a powerful being comparable to a sage, a demigod, or a great demon, depending.\n4: As a minor deity.\nFor every 10 health the legion has, roll:\n1d4-1 limbs\n1d4-1 stat points, can be put in any stat that any creature it has consumed has possessed.\nWith no legs a Legion can roll at 2 spaces per move. Every leg gives it 1 extra space of speed, up to 6 legs. Up to 10 legs it gets another 1 space per pair.\nNon-leg limbs can include stingers, arms with hands, claws, pincers, torsos reduced to short spines with jaws mounted on the ends, etc. Just grab attacks from other enemies at random.\nRoll 1d4-2 for every 10 health the Legion has. The Legion has that many exposed organs randomly placed along the outside perimeter of its space. The organ can be targeted for double damage with Called Shot. If a called shot is performed doing over 8 slashing damage, the legion loses that limb, (3n3 to reattach).\nLegions take double damage from fire and take a max of two damage from piercing attacks (unless performed on an organ).\nWhen a Legion’s HP is reduced to 0, it can no longer move or function.\nRoll one fewer d20 than was used to create it. For every d20 rolled, the Legion has a day to reform. Every day it rolls a d20 to regain health. If it hits half health within the time allotted, it can reform. If its parts are scattered they might reform as smaller Legions, DM discretion. Reformed Legions retain their memories. Burned portions of the Legion are fully dead. Players may try other means to fully neutralize remains.\nLegions are generally hostile. They are driven by the desire to consume enough to grow larger, more powerful, more intelligent. They have to consume many times the amount of mass another creature of their size would have to. Legions do not need sleep. They are constantly hunting and eating. They hold grudges.\nGiven that they prey on everything they are universally hated. That is, of course, unless they grow large enough to become powerful allies. They are extremely difficult to eradicate. Their invisible spores hang in the air waiting to colonize the sick or recently deceased. There are whispered stories of those who, in a desperate bid to survive, seek a symbiotic relationship by cultivating Legion within themselves. There is no documented case of this working.\nThis file was last auto-generated on 2022-12-01."

They should both use custom Python preprocessing.\nIn addition to the relatively simple curly templating of the sort {die-roll entity (die-roll??)}, there should be a more robust templating syntax that will just pass the contained text to argparse. Maybe this will be: {$ enlist -fi weapons -fx basic} or similar… Worth noting here that enlist would basically never be used for this on its own, rather a new CLI command needs to be written to allow the user to run a filter to return a custom-sorted format-specified set of entities, similar to what is done in update.py, but more specifically md_updater() and similar.\nWile made a set of regex replaces that might fix the ol’ longtable fuckery problem."
