    "text": "Isopod Anatomy, Movement\nIsopods have thick layered bands of chitin along their top side. This forms their natural armor. They have seven pairs of jointed appendages. Each appendage ends in two articulated long sticky fingers. The two front pairs of appendages are the longest, with long fingers meant for fine manipulation. Lacking thumbs, the Isopods use their arms in vertical pairs with the two suspended top fingers and two suspended bottom fingers working in tandem, each finger opposable. The appendages after the foremost pairs become shorter and their main purpose shifts from manipulation to movement. They move low, using all of the limbs that line their body. They move parallel to the ground, with the bulk of their limbs folded under them. Isopods are larger than humans, though of course they are shorter when walking. They do not call their movement “crawling”.\nThey will tip their front portions upward in a couple of situations. The first is when engaged in some especially demanding manual task where lifting something in front of themselves using only a couple of limb pairs is not enough, as when playing musical instruments or when weaving. The second is when in a posture of deference or trust."

    "text": "Fighting\nThey fight low to the ground, taking advantage of the protection offered by the bands of chitinous armor on their backs. Because of this low fighting position and the arrangement of their limbs they rarely employ weapons that require large swinging motions, preferring to rely largely on long thrusting weapons. There are no Isopodan greataxes.\n\nMelee\nIn close quarters they employ katars, patas, and insectoid claw weapons. They also wield long shields held parallel to the ground. Sometimes these are lined with spikes.\n\nPolearms\nThey often wield spears, grasping them with many arm-pairs at a time, coordinating arm pairs to thrust the weapon forward. They also wield a unique variety of polearm, called a “fork” by outsiders (the proper name can only be expressed via pheromone). Forks are long asymmetric polearms with sharp spear points at the end. The heads of the polearm are always flat on one side so that they be easily wielded near the ground. The opposite side can have a wide variety of features, the most common being a long and gently curved wavy blade sticking out at a right angle, sharp on both sides. This can be used defensively to keep an opponent at bay but it can also be used to hook a limb, at which point the Isopod uses their many arm pairs in tandem to wrench the blade back. If the Isopod has a spiked shield or katar they can pull the opponent closer with the blade while attacking with their sidearm, trapping them between the weapons.\nThe forks excel when used to fight other bugs. They can be used to attack the rows of delicate limbs. They can be slipped under another shelled creature, turned so that the blade faces upward, and then torn across the soft underbelly of the opponent, bypassing their armor entirely.\nTheir polearms are made of an extremely sharp and light organic material. The finest, sharpest, and lightest of their polearms are marbled by many colors. The secretive Isopodan craftsmen have accrued thousands of years experience and knowledge crafting these deadly polearms. Because of the effectiveness of the weapons against the Isopods themselves, they do not trade them with other groups and they keep careful track of them. A non-isopod simply being in posession of a marbled isopodan fork is seen as an act of open hostility.\n\n\n\nRanged\nThey use their long powerful fore-limbs to throw out rope darts or barbed blades, then they either retract the projectiles or attach the ropes to the surfaces of the cave, suspending the opponent from multiple points. They also use crossbows that they can quickly wind with their limb-pairs if they flip over. They cannot wield normal bows and slings effectively."

Many of these documents have outlived their original purpse, but through addendums, conditions, and stipulations, they persist as perversions of their original forms. It isn’t known who started the network or whether its creation was intentional. The network may have been an attempt to create laws that could themselves govern, interpret, and enforce.\nThe Bureau’s strength lies in their arcane use of information and agreements, not brute force. They rely on others to provide force. Sometimes they will formally parner with a group or civilization, sometimes they slowly permeate, infect, and ultimately capture the group."

    "text": "The Forerunner / Receptionist\n\nDescription\nA black cylinder is driven through a thick stack of written records and into the head of the slumped creature. Only the thing’s gumless wheezing mouth is visible. The pages covering its face are of all sizes. They are small cards, letters, entire scrolls, they are made of ancient papyrus and fine white cardstock, they are clay tablets, leaves, scalps, hides. Covering these records are handprints, wild script, dead languages, moving glyphs, bright red blood, every form of marking. Curdled black fluid oozes lazily from around the stack and down the front of the its atrophied body. It is fat and weak. It smells like mildew. It sits hunched over a thin table. It wears a collared shirt.\n\n\nFirst Encounter\nIt’s friendly. It asks questions about superficial qualities, name, eye color, height, etc. Then it starts asking innocuous questions about both the subject’s current state and some recent events the subject has experienced. It knows things it should not know. It requires answers from the subject, it requires that information is confirmed. As the conversation progresses it asks increasingly meaningless semantic questions. The questions become more invasive. It to asks its questions while darkly hinting at terrible consequences should the wrong answer be given. It asks the subject to pick from a set of nearly identical options. It is patient. It is meticulous.\nAs answers are given, it will tear out a stake from its pale flesh. The stake might be a pen or it might just be used as one. It patiently records what is said. It asks the same questions over and over in slightly different forms, explaining how the questions are different when challenged.\nIt will insist that the subject is lucky to have run across the Bureau when they did, otherwise their debts and obligations may have grown to catastrophic proportions, now at least the subject can take control.\nAs the stake runs out of ink the Bureaucrat will drive it back into the wound to refill it. As the interaction progresses it will insist that the subject take certain forms and pens, filling out the forms, recording and reporting their actions, submitting the forms. It will insist that, to better make sure the forms are tracked and kept safe, the subject simply must allow the bureaucrat to attach the form directly to the subject with a small pin. This is, of course, just a small note to be attached with a small pin, it’s a convenient magic that allows the subject to never misplace the form.\nThe more information a subject gives and the more a subject engages, the more power the Bureau has over the subject. The Receptionist might first appear when the character is weak or in need, offering a service, information, or healing. It never specifies what it wants in return, if asked it will give a long explanation about how the service is not only free but it also entitles you to unspecified future services, advantages, and “opportunities”. If pressed it might admit that yes there could be some minor service fees but these are merely a formality, they can be waived or some arrangement could be found.\nThe Receptionist is after two things, information and some reason to be involved. It wants the subject to be visible, registered, quantified. It wants a confirmation of some instance in which the subject was wronged or perhaps wronged another. It wants the subject to accept some aid from the Bureau or accept some deal with the Bureau. The Receptionist is almost always the first member of the Bureau that any given character meets.\n\n\nMisc.\nWhen faced with a Receptionist the best move is to say nothing and kill it where it sits. This will make an enemy of the faction unless it is done from stealth or otherwise untraceable.\nThe Bureau cannot see art. It is literally invisible to them, its effects unknowable. Because of this it is not uncommon for illiterate travelers to carry books of poetry in order to beat to death Bureaucrats that appear in front of them.\nThe body of a Bureaucrat is good as a source of cheap ink and kindling."

Most of the expression of skill and weapon uniqueness come from effects/conditions/crit damage triggered by the attack roll.\n\n\n\nLight: 1\nMedium: 1-&gt;2\nHeavy: 2, 2-&gt;3\nGiant: 3\n\n\n\n\nThese tags describe the type of damage that the weapon does.\nThere are three major types of damage. They are: [B] for “Bludgeoning”, [P] for “Piercing” and [S] for “Slashing”. There are also sub-types like [Severing], [Slicing], and [Picking]. [Severing] counts as the more generic [S], but [S] does not count as [Severing]. The damage sub-type will share the first letter of the more generic damage type. This has worked so far because there are very many words in english and they are conveniently placed. I am not afraid to resort to attic greek or something to keep this stupid system working.\nSome weapons do two types of damage only for the purposes of armor damage reduction, only the first gets to be used for skills (that’s bad). This looks like: [B]/[P]\n\n\n[Slicing]: What a saber does. Long fast drawing cut, often with a curved blade.\n[Severing]: What an axe does. A chopping motion2.\n[Picking]: What a warpick does.\n\n\n\n[Bashing]: Not sure what sort of blunt weapon would blunt in a way that is different enough to justify this damage type, but it is there.\n[Pickling]: What a warpickle does.\n\n\n\n[Striking]: Don’t do this.\n[Stabbing]: Please don’t do this.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F0dQgrzN-6pcHPDZExC7pSu5xIdd3tqt3Z-oVc8CK0g/edit?pli=1#gid=437119287\n\n\n\nDropping a weapon is a free action. Putting a second hand on a one-handed weapon is a free action. Removing a hand from a weapon or any other minor adjustment is also a free action. Drawing a weapon costs 1 AP. Picking a weapon up off the ground costs 1 AP and you’re [vulnerable] while you’re doing it, you can be interrupted with an attack while you duck down to grab a weapon. Putting a weapon away costs 1 AP.\n\n\n\nIf you’re below a weapon’s requirements, you get no score based damage scaling (+SCORE) when using that weapon.

    "text": "Some weapons deal flat damage, some (often large weapons) roll for damage. Most of the expression of skill and weapon uniqueness come from effects/conditions/crit damage triggered by the attack roll.\n\n\n\nLight: 1\nMedium: 1-&gt;2\nHeavy: 2, 2-&gt;3\nGiant: 3\n\n\n\n\nThese tags describe the type of damage that the weapon does.\nThere are three major types of damage. They are: [B] for “Bludgeoning”, [P] for “Piercing” and [S] for “Slashing”. There are also sub-types like [Severing], [Slicing], and [Picking]. [Severing] counts as the more generic [S], but [S] does not count as [Severing]. The damage sub-type will share the first letter of the more generic damage type. This has worked so far because there are very many words in english and they are conveniently placed. I am not afraid to resort to attic greek or something to keep this stupid system working.\nSome weapons do two types of damage only for the purposes of armor damage reduction, only the first gets to be used for skills (that’s bad). This looks like: [B]/[P]\n\n\n[Slicing]: What a saber does. Long fast drawing cut, often with a curved blade.\n[Severing]: What an axe does. A chopping motion2.\n[Picking]: What a warpick does.\n\n\n\n[Bashing]: Not sure what sort of blunt weapon would blunt in a way that is different enough to justify this damage type, but it is there.\n[Pickling]: What a warpickle does.\n\n\n\n[Striking]: Don’t do this.\n[Stabbing]: Please don’t do this.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F0dQgrzN-6pcHPDZExC7pSu5xIdd3tqt3Z-oVc8CK0g/edit?pli=1#gid=437119287\n\n\n\nDropping a weapon is a free action. Putting a second hand on a one-handed weapon is a free action. Removing a hand from a weapon or any other minor adjustment is also a free action. Drawing a weapon costs 1 AP. Picking a weapon up off the ground costs 1 AP and you’re [vulnerable] while you’re doing it, you can be interrupted with an attack while you duck down to grab a weapon. Putting a weapon away costs 1 AP.\n\n\n\nIf you’re below a weapon’s requirements, you get no score based damage scaling (+SCORE) when using that weapon. Your max To-Hit modifier is 0 with that weapon. For every point you are below a SCORE requirement, halve the damage you do rounding up. If you would do 1 damage you cannot wield the weapon.\n\n\n\n\nFor every point you are below requirements for the weapon, halve the range.

    "text": "Injury and Death\nThis part consistently needs reworking.\n\nInjury\nInjuries are unique conditions that typically come with crit damage. Injuries are removed when the character reaches full crit health.\n\n\nDying Instantly or Being Stabilized\nIf you are reduced to -(Max HP/2) you die instantly.\nIf your HP is brought above 0, you are stabilized. If you are stabilized but you haven’t reached 6 HP, rest (rolling recovery dice) until you reach 6 HP. If you’re brought back to 6 HP or more, regain consciousness.\n\nBeing Reduced to 0 HP, Being “Downed”\nYou can have negative HP. You can also stabilize even with negative HP, but you have to reach 6 HP before you regain consciousness.\nWhen a player is reduced to 0 but not killed, they are “down” and they are unconscious. If they are not stabilized, they are unable to take any sort of action besides rolling death checks. They are [vulnerable].\nWhen a player is downed the DM sets a death DC by rolling 2d6 with no modifiers. The DM does not tell the player the DC.\nOn the turn a player is downed and on every subsequent turn, the player rolls a death check and tells the DM their roll. If their roll matches or passes the DC it’s a success. If the roll is below the DC, it’s a failure. If the roll is a failure, the DM notes by how much the roll failed, DC - roll. This difference will be used to determine the consequence of the failure using the consequence table. Don’t make any extra rolls to resolve consequences at this point as other characters might use medicine to improve the outcome, skills might be triggered, etc. Consequences are only resolved if/when the character survives.\n3 successes means the character stabilizes at their current HP. 3 failures means they die.\nOnce they either hit 3 successes or 3 failures, the DM tells them to stop rolling. They are not told whether they died or not or what consequences they might have. They only find out once someone goes to check on their character.\nIf you’re hit while you’re down, take the damage and add a failed death check.\n\n\n\nConsequence Tables\nConsequence tables exist to determine what happens if you fail death checks. Different areas might have different consequence tables, the DM might pick a table completely randomly. Different campaigns might prefer harsher or more lenient consequenes. Having many consequence tables and an unknown death DC should make being downed stressful and full of uncertainty, this can increase the stakes while not necessarily increasing the chance that the character dies. Below is a sample generic consequence table and some sample consequences.\n\n\n\nFailure\nConsequence\n\n\n\n\n-1\n[weak] (1 Hour)\n\n\n-2\n[weak] (8 Hours)\n\n\n-3\nScars, [frail] (8 Hours),\n\n\n-4\nScars, [frail] (1 Day), Lower 1 Stat\n\n\n-5\nScars, [frail] (2 Days), Lower 1 Stat\n\n\n-6, -7\nScars, Lame\n\n\n-8, -9, -10\nLose a Limb\n\n\n\n\nConsequences\n[weak]\n-1 STR, -1 CON, -2 to Defense\n[frail]\n-1 STR, -2 CON, -1 AGI, -3 to Defense\nScars\nScars are completely cosmetic and up to DM discretion. The scar might be from the blow that downed the character or they might be from some other large blow received in the same fight.\nLower a Stat\nLower a stat by 1 by rolling a d4 using the following table:\n\n\n\nStat\nRoll\n\n\n\n\nSTR\n1\n\n\nAGI\n2\n\n\nDEX\n3\n\n\nCON\n4\n\n\n\nLame\nTake your first move action as normal.

    "text": "Attribute Scores\nA character’s basic qualities or problem solving tools are described by the attributes they have and the scores given to those attributes. If a character is missing an attribute from their sheet they cannot make checks using that attribute and they automatically fail any contest related to that score. What this represents is that, as a character, they do not use that attribute to solve problems. A pack animal does not have any SOCial or any DEXterity. Scores can be negative. Having an attribute with a negative score is more useful than not having that score at all. When you create your character, your species and background will determine what attributes and scores you start with.\nA character’s attribute scores are added to rolls, checks, and modifiers as well as the “passive” score. A character’s “passive” score for a given attribute is 6 + SCORE. This is the score other characters roll checks against.\n\nGetting New Attributes, Raising Your Attribute Scores\nThe attributes a character can have are not limited to what is on the default character sheet. There are others, such as MEDicine or PYROmancy. Some scores are harder to obtain than others. All of the scores listed here work the usual way. When new scores are being written and tested they will be linked here on a page dedicated to scores and skills.\nAll of the following attribute score rules are “unless otherwise stated”. Your score in a given attribute starts at -2 when you acquire it. Skill Points or “SP” are used both to buy skills and raise attribute scores. Each Skill is priced individually, but they typically cost less than 10 SP. The price for raising an attribute score is 10 SP while the score is negative. Once your score reaches 0, every subsequent increase costs an amount of SP equal to the new score times 10. That means that going from -1 to 0 costs 10 SP, going from 0 to 1 costs 10 SP, going from 1 to 2 costs 20 SP, going from 2 to 3 costs 30 SP and so on.\n\n\n\nAttribute Score\nCost\nTotal Cost to Reach Score\n\n\n\n\n-2\n10\n10\n\n\n-1\n10\n20\n\n\n0\n10\n30\n\n\n1\n10\n40\n\n\n2\n20\n60\n\n\n3\n30\n90\n\n\n4\n40\n130"

If their roll is the same or higher than the DS, they succeed.\nIf two charactes are in direct competition they are in a “contest”. They both roll 2d6 and add their scores. The higher score wins.

    "text": "Crits and More\nIf a character rolls in a check or contest and the they succeed, they check the face values on the dice they rolled. They may have skills or effects that are activated on one of three “critical rolls” or die combinations. These are listed below\nFull Crit: Rolling two 6s.\nMatching Crit: Rolling two matching face values.\nHalf Crit: Rolling at least one 6.\nAn example of one of these effects is a character who inflicts the [bleed] condition on half crit when dealing [Slicing] damage. Notice that rolling a Full Crit activates both the Half Crit and Matching Crit conditions.\nThere is only one condition that can be activated when a character fails, the Total Failure.\nTotal Failure: Rolling two 1s.\nGetting a Full Crit when attacking always means dealing 1 more crit damage. Otherwise, rolling a Full Crit means succeeded at your task as well as you could have. Likewise, rolling a Total Failure means you did as badly at the task as you could have. The effect of these dramatic successes and failures is up to DM discretion. Not all checks or contests will involve a great distinction between success and dramatic success. \n\n\nCrit and Crit Fail\nCrit Fails are maximally bad. You did as badly as you could have done (~3% probability).\nDouble 6s are good. You did as good as you could have. If this is an attack roll, do 1 extra crit damage on top of any other effects.\n\n\nAdvantage/Disadvantage\nWhen you have “advantage”, roll another die during your check, pick two. When you have “disadvantage”, roll another die, pick the two lowest. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, but they are also cumulative. That is, if somehow you have disadvantage on a check twice, but advantage four times, two of the advantages and disadvantages cancel out, and you get double advantage. So, you roll four dice and pick two. Because you can pick two rather than having to take the two highest rolls, you can be strategic with the effects you activate. For example, if you roll a 6, two 4s, and a 2, you may choose to lower your roll’s total from a 10 (4+6) to an 8 (4+4) in order to activate an effect triggered by matching dice if you succeed (otherwise you would get a half crit)."

    "text": "Initiative and AP (Action Points)\nAP is used during “initiative”. Initiative is any situation where many characters want to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen is important. Initiative is most often combat, but it can include other time sensitive events like chases or races.\nEver character has 3 AP cards unless otherwise noted. The cards say “1 AP” and indicate what character they belong to with a name, a symbol, or both. Most actions cost 1 AP, but you can do a reasonable amount of simple things like talking for free. Some characters have skills or specializtions that allow them to have extra AP cards. These often have use requirements, like the Bruiser skill which grants 1 AP that can only be spent on an attack costing 2 or more AP.\nWhen initiative starts all characters pass their table sets to the DM. In addition to AP, the table set can also include special ability or effect cards. The DM shuffles the table sets together to create the table deck. The DM pulls a card from the top of the deck and either deals the card to the character/player that it belongs to or follows the rules on the card. When a character is dealt a card they can choose to act, spending however many cards they currently have in their hand. They can also just hold on to the card, adding it to their hand. When cards are spent or activated they get placed in the table discard. Any character can interrupt at any time, spending 1 AP to act immediately. The round ends when the table deck is empty and everyone who still has AP has had a chance to use interrupt. Acting at the end of a round requires using interrupt.\nCards are discarded or spent are shuffled together to create the table deck for the next round while cards that are trashed or removed are not shuffled in at the end of the round and return to the table set after initiative ends completely unless otherwise stated.\nTable Deck: This is the deck of cards that the DM (or whoever) draws from during initiative. The deck that the whole table uses.\nTable Discard: The discard pile for the whole table.\nTable Set: Each character’s personal set of cards that they add to the table deck when initiative starts.\nHand: The cards that you have been dealt and are holding on to.\nDiscard/Spend: Cards that have been used or removed that go to the discard and are shuffled together next round to make the table deck.\nTrashed/Removed: Cards that have been used or removed and do not get shuffled back in every round.\nTrash: The trash pile for the whole table.\nIf you want to act, speak up before the DM moves on! Remember, you can spend 1 AP at any time to act immediately.\n\nMultiple-&gt;AP-&gt;Costs\nSome types of actions have multiple AP costs. The first time you perform the action in a round it costs the first amount, the second time it costs the second, etc. These costs are connected with arrows, like this: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3.\n\nAP Shenanigans: Temp AP, Losing AP, Gaining AP, the “Wait” action\n“Temp AP” must be spend in the same round it is recieved. If you do nothing for an entire round, regain 1 AP from the trash if you have lost any.\n\n\n\n“Beginning of the Round”\nSometimes the particular order things happen in the “beginning of the round” will matter. In that case, they resolve in this order.\n\n1. Effect Managment\nAny already active effects that trigger “at the beginning of a round” happen first. They happen before anything else in the round does. Examples includes taking damage from [poison] or [bleed] or gaining health from [heal]. If you have an effect active that causes you to do some sort of roll or contest, do that now.\n\n\n2. Status Management\nStatuses are added or removed now. A point of [poison] is removed, a point of [heal] is removed, anything that would end at the “beginning” of this round ends now.\n\n\n\n3. Skills\nSome moves and skills can be used “at the beginning of the round”. These must be used after effects and statuses resolve."

    "text": "What kind of game is this?\nThe base rules should be flexible enough that they can be modified to run many types of games in many types of settings. That being said, the setting, weapons, etc. presented in this site are focused on creating a game where the player characters are not inherently special. This game is about normal people making their way through a dangerous and fantastic world.\n\n\nTone and Goals\nThe world of this game is much bigger than the players and it moves without any concern for them. When players meet a creature there should be no expectation that they will be able to kill it. If players pick a fight they can’t win, that’s on them. Characters might lose limbs. They might die as a part of normal combat. The game is not built to make players straightforwardly more powerful over time, but that doesn’t mean they have no agency. Players have resources to advance their characters. If a player wants more health, they choose to spend their limited resources on health. The same is true for skills. Characters should grow in response to the pressures they face. Characters become better at what they try to do, they do not progress smoothly along a given plan. There are no classes and there are no levels. There is no destination. There are only small people and their unreasonable efforts and goals.\nThere are skills for fantastic magic powers as well as more mundane abilities such as quickly drawing a weapon, disarming an opponent, parrying a blow, and effective use of a shield. Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, different weapons have different AP costs, different reach. Some might be better at slashing than piercing. A player should think carefully about what they take with them and what they can do with it. The reason for the great historical variety of weapons is that different designs work better in different contexts and for different purposes. I’d like a game that lets you engage with that dynamic and expands on it with interesting and relatively light mechanics.\nIn general, the context a character finds themselves in at any point is hugely important. Say you have a very advanced knight-type character with all sorts of skills. He’s in heavy armor standing guard. There’s a relatively weak early-game assassin character who has specialized in stealth and sneak attacks. The assassin has a long thin dagger meant for slipping through armor. The assassin manages to catch the knight unaware, prepares his strike, and drives the dagger through his neck. The knight is probably dead. In a direct fight the assassin would have no chance at all. This, basically, is how balance is handled (or not handled). The quality of skills, weapons, and character types depend on context and creativity. If you’re that knight standing guard, you probably want to invest in your perception, you probably want someone watching your back. In general, you should be thinking about what other people might try, you should be thinking about your vulnerabilities and how you’re going to deal with them.\nCombat is not orderly. You should be trying to take every advantage you can find. You should be trying to break the game. The flexibility of the system should give you the freedom to engage with combat in whatever way seems fun or interesting to you. Yan could set up status effects and conditions to trigger very powerful moves. You can dodge and weave around attacks, finding an opening for a critical strike. You can use illusion and deception. You can make a big unga-bunga man who wields a club made from a whole tree. Maybe this was a weapon that was never meant to be wielded by a player character, a weapon from some great troll boss. As long as you have the right set of attributes, you can use it. You could also just talk your way out of a fight or sneak around and avoid the interaction entirely. Set up distractions, traps, bribe someone so you find out your enemies weaknesses beforehand. The way that you deal with situations should be unique to your character and your skillset.\nAn old wizard beset by bandits doesn’t have 10 times as much Health as they do because he’s “a high level wizard”. He might have less health than they do. However, he has the tools and knowledge to make such an encounter trivial anyway.\nThere are games that are built to make you feel a lot more powerful than everyone else in the game world, games that are far better suited to playing out the story of a legendary adventurer who went from hunting rats to slaying dragons. This is not that game. This is a game about people exploring dangerous places, taking risks, and beating genuinely bad odds with quick thinking, preparation, and luck.\nOn top of all this, the game should be relatively rules-light. When rules show up they should add to the tactility of the world not take it away. They should give you more options, they should be easy to improvise and easy to improvise with. There should be no superfluous rules for “realism”. While there is a baseline of universal rules and mechanics, a player should largely get to choose what specific mechanics they use to interact with the world, whether that’s risk-reward mechanics, complex chained effects, AP cleverness, Big Numbers, thinking of the perfect illusion at the perfect time, or social charm. Players aren’t restricted to one class or the options in that class, they can combine skills and mechanics in any way they can manage.\nThese are a lot of goals in this doc. The currently existing game is an attempt at reaching toward those goals. Many of these goals are in a great deal of tension with one another."

Rolls are used to express a particular character’s social talents, but they don’t replace what a character says or does. Grading numerical difficulty for a social interaction is difficult. A GM cannot prepare beforehand for the things a player will do or say, so DCs have to be set on the fly. Sometimes they are set incorrectly or something breaks. In this case, ignore the system/roll and do whatever is the most sensible/interesting/funny.

People are willing to help you out. They want to see you do well.\n\n\n1\nLiked\nYou are liked. People want to talk and barter.\n\n\n0\nNeutral\nPeople don’t think much of you one way or another. They have the time to talk.\n\n\n-1\nDisliked\nPeople will give you bad deals in trade. They do not particularly want to talk to you. They do not want to barter.\n\n\n-2\nStrongly Disliked\nPeople do not want to talk or trade. They want you to go away.\n\n\n-3\nLoathed\nYou are a pariah.

Your name, face, and terrible actions are known. A group will send paid assassins and soldiers after you. An individual will go to great lengths and take on great risk and personal cost in order to do as much harm as possible to you.\n\n\n\nThe framework for setting a DC for a given social roll can also be used as a framework for managing a character’s reputation among different groups. The scores range from -6 (“Reviled”) to +6 (“Revered”). These scores can be used by a GM to easily keep track of relationships and attitudes. They are also mechanical modifiers. If a character is at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”) with some group or individual, subtract 2 from their social check and/or their passive social score.\nYou can use these scores to set a sort of “default” attitude or bias for NPCs. The kindly innkeeper in a small peaceful town might treat every new person at around +2 (“Well-Liked”). The sneering guards in front of a keep might treat everyone at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”). Another traveler on the road just trying to get to where they’re going might be at -1 (“Disliked”) just because they really don’t want to stop and chat. The same traveler might, if you help them out, switch to +1 (“Liked”).\nIf a player passes the DC, treat their interaction as happening at 1 point higher than it would be otherwise. If the player exceeds the DC by more than 3, treat the interaction as +2.\nAn example: a player character is in a town in which they are at -3 (“Loathed”). Typically, this would mean that they are treated as a pariah, people are unwilling to talk to them and will actively attempt to get rid of them. They might be thrown in jail on made up charges. If they are very charismatic they may be able to walk into a shop, attempt to talk the owner into selling them something and recieve a +2 for the interaction. The shop owner might think that the player character doesn’t seem quite as bad as people say, maybe he thinks that he is misremembering something or getting the player character confused with someone else. He is still wary, however. He still treats the character as -1 or “Disliked”, he will tend not to want to barter. He’ll want to get through the interaction quickly. Similarly, a guard treating everyone at -2 might be persuaded to relax a bit and just talk to the player character on neutral terms (-2 -&gt; 0).\nRemember that the good will from one positive social interaction does not last forever. Actions will tend to have a greater effect than words. If you just stabbed someone, you are not going to be able to smooth that over with your wit and charm.\nThe table with specific characterizations is useful, but it can be boiled down to some rules of thumb. 0 is neutral. From +1 to +3 the character is favored. Persuasion, information gathering, and bartering will be easier. People give you the benefit of the doubt. From +3 to +6 people will go out of their way to help you, they will likely come to your aid in combat or follow you into combat. From -1 to -3 people dislike you and generally do not want to have anything to do with you. -4 to -6 is when you start seeing a lot of unprovoked violence.\nThere are several different ways a GM can deal with this system in game. The system can be player-facing. You could tell your players their numerical reputation among different groups or numerical values for the attitudes of various characters. A DM could gate numerical information behind something like a good insight roll. A DM can also keep the entire system completely to themsleves, as a tool for the to structure descriptions and interactions.\n\n\n\n“Social perception” is used here to refer to skills that allow you to roll to sense motives, detect deceit, and gain insight into another character’s emotional state. When a player asks a question that would fall under “social perception” about another character, they should first be given a superficial description of the character and their apparent emotional state. If the character in question seems to be at ease, the GM should just say so. This is true even if the character in question is only pretending to be at ease, but plans to attack or betray the player’s character. The rules and skills for social perception are not meant to cover the superficial. These rules are for attempts to read another character. Social perception rolls are very similar to other character conflicts, they can be either a check or a contest.\n\n\n\nWhen the roll is a check, the DC will be the usual passive DC, 6 + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills, bias, reputation). If you are trying to read a character who is is lying the DC will be set by their initial attempt to lie, which will have been a check + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills) against your passive social perception. If they attempt to lie and fail this check, then whatever they said will be described as highly suspicious. If they succeed in their initial check, but you pass their DC when you attempt to read them, you will notice that something seems wrong, you might notice inconsistencies in what they said, they might seem nervous or suspicious.\nSocial perception rolls are almost always checks. If you are lying to someone, you perform a check. If they are trying to figure out if you are lying, they perform a check. If someone is trying to convince you of something and you think they might be lying, you perform a check.\n\n\nIn the case of a tie, resolution is the same as any other check. Defender wins. Otherwise there are four possible outcomes.\nIf you pass the check more than 3, Complete Success:\nYou read the defender like an open book. You get a full answer to whatever question you were asking, or as full an answer as you could get from watching someone. They crumble at your gaze. Maybe they are so caught off guard that they mention something they should not have.\nIf you pass the check by 3 or less, Moderate Success:\nYou get some insight into the question you were asking. If you are trying to see if someone is lying, you’ll know that they’re not telling the whole truth, that they are actively misleading you. If you’re trying to get insight into someone’s emotional state, you get a good idea of how they are feeling. You might be able to tell that someone is distressed and trying to hide it. This is a pretty good read of someone. They do not know that you know anything.\nIf you fail the check by 3 or less, Moderate Failure:\nYou have no answer to your question at all and the person you were attempting to read knows what you were doing. If you were trying to figure out if someone was lying about a specific claim, they know that you don’t trust them or that you suspect them in some way. Otherwise, you might just be staring and it’s weird.\nIf you fail the check by more than 3, Catastrophic Failure:\nGod have mercy on your soul. You completely give yourself away, your interests and your question are written all over your face. If you are trying to catch a lie, not only is it clear what exactly you think is being lied about, it’s clear that you have no idea if the defender is lying. Maybe you scoffed at a specific claim, maybe you blurt out some crucial piece of information at exactly the wrong time. Your face is very red.\n\n\n\n\nContests are far rarer than checks. Social perception contests happen in contexts where it is understood that both parties are trying to advance their own interests. Some examples of this would be a tense negotiation, an official dinner of ambassadors whose states are on the brink of war, a game of poker, spies meeting to trade secrets while not revealing their true interests. In these cases checks would be happening simultaneously anyway, and the information that someone might doubt what you are saying or that they might not be telling the whole truth wouldn’t be very meaningful.\nContest Resolution is just about the same as check resolution. The difference between the rolls of the two characters determines which character succeeds and which fails, and to what degree. This success and failure are captured by the same event. For example one character might give away information they shouldn’t have, which captures both the success of one character and the failure of another.\nTies are just ties, a staredown, a tense silence. If your group prefers, ties can be resolved in the normal way for a contest: win goes to the higher modifier, if that’s a tie, it’s a tie in game. If that outcome makes no sense, roll again."

Additionally there are only a few types of crust punks, and they’re not very important, but they still end up in this section… Maybe that’s fine?\nThey are SALT encrusted and delusional. They know the Art of Continuous Secretion. Their skin is covered in layers of hard grey crystal salt. Their body constantly produces SALT, so they have to constantly burn SALT to stay alive. Having a lot of SALT makes them near superhuman, having little cripples them. They must always stay awake as SALT buildup would kill them in their sleep. The solution to their exhaustion and the mental toll of their sleeplessness is burning more SALT. This abuse of SALT wears them down mentally and physically, a side effect that can only be addressed with even more SALT. Their dependence on SALT tends to outpace their production, and they live in a frantic search for more.\nTheir fingers are sharp clumsy daggers of salt. Their limited hand mobility makes them bad at using most weapons. When they fight, salt armor covers and envelopes their body. They fight “unarmed”, with enormous spiked fists made of salt. Most of them fight like terrifying incoherently screaming superhuman brawlers in grinding mineral plate armor. A few crust punks instead burn their SALT by moving very quickly, cutting with enormous katars fused to their closed fist during combat. Crust punks do not wear armor, it would just constrain their natural salt armor.\nSome crust punks are miners who rejected a life of toil, preferring a short brutal life of glorious combat. It’s common for powerful or sloppy crust punks to die crystallized by their own continuous SALT production, leaving behind a sparkling statue.\n\nGameplay Note\nPlayers might be able to learn unarmed techniques (including with brass knuckles, push-daggers) and improved physical augmentation through salt from them, but more likely they’re going to get jumped by a bunch of crust punks who beat them and take their SALT."

Having it obscure vision like an object made DMing hard, it was effectively a fog of war but with a lot of extra parts and mechanics. Too much.\nMist can create a sort of combined claustrophobia and agoraphobia. There is a great deal of space all around you but you cannot into it, you do not know what is in it."

    "text": "On Mist Breathing\nSome people can breathe the mist in, swim through it, even fly through it. In general, this is controlled with an upward force on an inhale and a downward force (or for more advanced users, potentially no force) on an exhale.\nBreathing the mist has side effects, mainly that one becomes more like the things in the mist, pale and alien. Sometimes those who breathe in the mist become unable to survive outside of the mist.\nSpoiler territory.\nTravelers from the mist that have grown dependent on it must use a rebreather, most often embedded in a mask. They practice a sort of circular breathing. This is pretty unpleasant, it can even feel unsanitary. The masks typically have a valve through which clean air can be brought in and one through which mist can be exhaled."

    "text": "Setpiece: Whaling, Hunting\nHunting in the mists is dangerous and lucrative. The mists are full of terrifying, dangerous, and enormous creatures whose oil, blood, eyes, fins, bones, are exteremly valuable. There are many designs for traversing the mists, Rafts pulled by flying creatures, zeppelins, and rumors of much stranger ships using arcane propulsion systems. Ships traveling through the mist need closed cabins, fires on the deck to ward the mist away or fans. The sailors often have breathing filters, often mounted inside of inverse mist-masks, styled to look like the real thing.\nAn easy setpiece would be to have the characters work for passage on a whaling vessel, or just work on one. Whaling campaign???\nNeed a table for the deleterious effects of mist breathing, growing fins, going blind, only being able to breathe the mist, various delusions, overpowering desire to hunt and eat schools of fish. This sort of thing. Higher probability of worse outcomes as you breathe more in, some small possibility of good outcomes."

    "text": "Chadwriter: Writing for Chads (in Loric)\n\n\nJust type Loric romanization (both the plain ASCII style (bb) and the fancy Unicode style (ḅ) are supported) into the input box, and Loric glyphs for that text will appear below. G maps to K and D to T, as those distinctions are not found in written Loric. C represents the extremely rare optional explicit “null vowel” letter. ’ is the character you have to put after a consonant to indicate its vowel was implicit, and if followed by another of the same letter, should not be interpreted as geminate. _ is reserved for internal use, and is forbidden to occur in your input texts. In cursive mode, if you type an invalid sequence of vowels and consonants, this will result in an invalid input indicator. Compositional straightive, and decompositional cursive, (two later & eccentric innovations of Loric printing presses) remain unimplemented here. Stacked dashes are unimplemented, but the rest of the punctuation is implemented—with fairly arbitrary ascii characters for many of them. Not all of the conventions of this project would seem idiomatic to a Loric speaker. If you don’t have lettermapping.css in this directory, run ./make-css-classes &gt; lettermapping.css in this directory to generate it.\n\n\nWriting style:  cursive  straightive   unlinated straightive"
