Gnostic abilities might also leverage or change their effect based on the max GNOSIS of the target, so having a higher max GNOSIS (either from your passive score or temp increases in max GNOSIS) is a liability.\nGNOSIS should feel like a liability, using gnostic abilities should always feel risky. Pulling this off might involve a consequence table that is rolled on when gnostic effects are created.\nGNOSIS is knowledge, information, so failed attempts to use gnostic abilities will result in the user believing things that are wrong.\nMaybe at the beginning of a day, or after meditation, you “refill” your gnostic capacity up to your GNOSIS.

    "text": "“Salt” comes in two forms. The first is the alchemically active SALT found deep in the earth or in the End (this is used as a magical resource, so to avoid confusion it’s written in all caps, “SALT”). The second is any adulterated form of the first, including the sort of salt used in cooking. Alchemical SALT can be transformed into a much larger amount of conventional salt, or it might be used to fuel some spell. SALT is the most common currency in the End and especially underground. SALT is measured in “flakes” denoted “f”. 1 full unit of SALT used in casting is equivalent in mass to 100f. SALT when ingested and used as a casting resource is like [poison] or [bleed], it’s a status effect tracked by tokens. Sometimes this is notated as [SALT]. [SALT] naturally wears off at the rate of 1 [SALT] per hour. Having [SALT] equal to or greater than 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn causes you to take 20 damage.\n\n\nThere are two common ways to use [SALT], “burning” over a long period, typically an hour, and “flaring”, or spending a lot of [SALT] in a short period for a larger effect. Flaring lasts anywhere from a single move to several hours depending on the ability. Burning and flaring both cost about 1-3 [SALT], typically. Anyone can learn to burn [SALT] though doing so is dangerous.\n\n\n\nIf your [SALT] is above 6 + HYLIC at the beginning of your turn, take 20 damage and lose 1 [SALT].\nThe total amount of [SALT] you are burning and flaring at any one time cannot exceed your HYLIC score (though your [SALT] itself can exceed your HYLIC).\nWhile you are burning [SALT] for an ability, that [SALT] still counts towards your total [SALT]. If you choose to shut off an ability before it would naturally go away, the ability ends, but the [SALT] still has to go away naturally."

    "text": "A basic character consists of a a list of attribute scores, a defense score, movement speed, and max HP (Health Points). The particular values for HP, defense, etc. will vary. Here is an example:\nHP: 18 + (6*CON), Defense: 6, Movement Speed: 4\n\n\n\nATTRIBUTE\nSCORE\n\n\n\n\nSTR(ENGTH)\n0\n\n\nAGI(LITY)\n0\n\n\nDEX(TERITY)\n0\n\n\nCON(STITUTION)\n0\n\n\nPER(CEPTION)\n0\n\n\nSOC(IAL)\n0\n\n\n\nA given character might also have skills, an inventory, conditions, or any number of other things. The names of attributes are typically shortened to the first three or four letters.\nA character with 0s all the way down their sheet is analogous to someone who is generally healthy, without any notable deficiencies or strengths. Having 0 in a score does not mean you cannot perform actions related to that score. You can have a negative score in an attribute. A -3 in a score means you can’t perform actions related to that score and anything you do related to that score fails.\n\n\nHP represents the characters health, CON increases your max HP by 6 * CON. When someone rolls to hit you, they are rolling their To-Hit check against your Defense. Move speed is how many spaces the character can move across at a time.\n\n\n\nScores are most commonly used as modifiers. For example, if you have 2 STR and use a weapon that is +STR To-Hit, you add 2 to your roll To-Hit. Scores are also used as prerequisites for obtaining skills or using certain weapons. Learning to pick pockets might require some minimum DEX, a giant club might require some minimum STR for effective use.\n\n\n\nWhen you roll “against” someone else’s score the number you have to beat, or “Difficulty Class” (or DC) is 6 + SCORE. The passive participant doesn’t roll (another way of thinking about it is that they are “assumed” to have rolled a 6). This is covered in greater detail in the section on checks and contests.\n\n\n\nIf you’re asked to perform a check with a score that you don’t see on your sheet, you can assume your score is 0 unless otherwise stated or the score has the [special] tag.\n\n\nIf you attempt to perform any action with a [special] score you don’t have, nothing happens. PYROMANCY is a [special] score. Having a PYROMANCY of 0 on your sheet means you are a mediocre pyromancer, not having PYROMANCY on your sheet means you are not a pyromancer. Sometimes the [special] tag is notated [s] for the sake of brevity.\n\n\n\n“Standard” scores are non-[special] scores that are very common or important in a given setting. In a fantasy setting STR is likely “standard” while MEDICINE is not. If you’re playing in a sci-fi setting with spying, hacking, and intrigue, TECH(NOLOGY) might be standard while AGI(LITY) is not. In this book STR, AGI, DEX, CON, PER and SOC are the standard scores."

    "section": "Doing Things",
    "text": "Doing Things\nWhen you’re trying to do something that you might fail at e.g. hitting someone with an axe or jumping over a chasm, you roll two six sided dice (notated 2d6) and add the relevant score. This number is your “roll”. To figure out if you succeed, you compare your roll to the “Difficulty Class”. The DC might be determined by the GM, or it might be determined by something in the world, like the abilities or attributes of another character. If the DC is stable and dependent on some fact about the world, it’s a check. If the DC is dependent on another character’s roll, then it’s a contest. When two characters roll opposing rolls, that’s a contest. When one character rolls, that’s a check.\n\nPerforming a Check Against a Score\nWhen a check is made “against a score”, the DC is 6 + SCORE. If you’re trying to poison someone and have to roll “against” their CON the DC is 6 + CON. The character that initiated the action and rolls is the “active” party, or “attacker”. The party that is being rolled against is the “passive” party, or “defender”. Defender wins ties.\n\n\nAn Example of a “Contest”\nContests directly compare the efforts of two characters. Arm wrestling is a good example of a contest. There’s no obvious number you have to beat, you just need to do better than the other guy. When participating in contests, you roll and then compare your roll to the “opposing” roll. If there’s is a tie, the person with the higher relevant score wins. If that’s a tie, either treat it as a tie in game, or if that makes no sense, do the contest again.\n\n\nAn Example of a “Check”\nYou might decide that you want to jump a large chasm, your GM tells you to roll agility (AGI), so you roll 2d6 and add your AGI score. The GM knows the DC which in this example might be 8. If you pass the DC you succeed. If you don’t, you fail, and the GM decides how that’s resolved.\nYou will almost never know the DC of a check before you try it, and you might not even know afterwards if the GM decides not to tell you. However, you should be able to get a good idea of a DC by the GMs description of the situation or by asking questions. If the GM describes the chasm as nearly impossible to jump over, you can be sure you’re looking at a DC above 10, probably around 12. If the GM says the gap is pretty small, barely worth worrying about, you can guess it’s probably a DC around 3 or 4.\n\n\nAction Points (AP), Moving, and the AP Tracker\nAction Points (AP) are the resource you use to do anything and everything. Characters have 3 AP unless otherwise stated. AP is regained at the beginning of every round. Every round takes about six seconds.\nThe AP cost of an action has two parts, the number of AP spent to perform the action and the number of rounds you have to wait to get that spent AP back. That is, “X AP cost, return the AP in Y turns”, or “X in Y”, notated as “(XnY)”. Most basic actions (including moving) are (1n1). You spend 1 AP to do it and you get that AP back at the beginning of the next round. There are some exhausting or difficult spells that might have a cost like (2n3 or 3n1). If you see “or”, you can choose either cost when you perform the action.\nYou can move a number of spaces equal to your speed (typically 20 feet or 4 spaces) for every move action you take. Move actions cost (1n1). Doing basic tasks like pulling a lever costs (1n1). Minor tasks like speaking or dropping something are free actions, you can do a “reasonable” amount of free actions during your turn, up to GM discretion.\nYou are always conceptually spending AP to do things, but you only have to track it in a context where several characters are trying to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen matters. Most often this is combat.\n\nMoves that have Multiple Costs\nIf you see a move that looks like “(1n1)->(2n1)->(3n1)” then the first time you do that action on your turn you pay the first cost, the second time you pay the second cost, the third time you pay the third. You’ll notice there is no fourth cost. If you want to use the move again (and had sufficient AP!), you would just pay the last listed cost again, (3n1).\n\n\nThe AP Tracker\nYou can track your AP by using the AP tracker on the top of your character sheet, it is the four boxes in a row numbered 0-3. Put three tokens on the tracker at “0”, these represent your AP. You can spend any AP that is at 0. When you spend AP, move the tokens for the spent AP to the box on the tracker with the number corresponding to the number of rounds that you have to wait to get the AP back. At the start of every round, move all tokens one space to the left (closer to 0) unless they’re already at 0.\nLet’s walk through an example. You start with 3 AP at the “0” space so you have 3 AP to spend. You perform an action that is (2n2) so you move 2 tokens to the “2” square. You then “move”, which is (1n1), so you move 1 token from the “0” square to the “1” square. You’re out of AP. At the start of the next round you move all of the tokens one box to the left, so you have 1 token at “0” and 2 tokens at “1”. That means you can spend 1 AP this turn. You decide to move, which is (1n1), so you move 1 AP to cell “1”. Now you have all 3 tokens on the “1” cell. At the start of the next round, all tokens move one step down, so they all go to the “0” cell and you have 3 AP to spend again.\nBy using this tracker you should never have to remember how many AP you’re supposed to have or when you get them back, you just spend AP that is at “0” and move all tokens to the left at the start of the round.\n\n\nPulling it all together, an example of attacking using AP\nLet’s say you have a longsword in one hand and you’re fighting a guy with chainmail armor. The longsword has a Basic Attack AP cost:“(1n1)->(2n1)”. It also has a slashing (S) move that does a d8 in damage as well as a piercing (P) move that does a d6 of damage. You slash first, paying (1n1). This does poorly against the opponents chain mail, so you try to the piercing attack for (2n1) (the second AP cost, because this is the second time you’ve used an attack this turn) and this does better, you get through more of your opponents armor. You don’t have enough AP to do a third attack, but if you did it would cost (2n1)."

    "section": "Initiative Rules",
    "text": "Initiative Rules\nThe initiative rules are used to cover any situation where several characters are trying to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen matters. Most often this will be combat but this can also be a chase scene, a race, or any other time the story is focused on action.\nThe ruleset that follows has not been tested much and will likely see some changes. This is the current state.\nA character’s initiative score is their AGI + or - any relevant bonuses or penalties.\nThe initiative scores of the players should always be public on some form of initiative tracker. As other characters reveal their initiative, they should be added to the tracker (and removed when they are no longer relevant).\nEvery round is divided into two phases, the Beginning Phase and the Main Phase.\n\nBeginning Phase - “Beginning of the Round”\nThis is mostly referred to as the “beginning of the round” by skills and effects. The whole table does not need to be synced up for this, everyone can manage their own character. There are three sub-phases to the beginning of the round. Most of the time this will not matter and you won’t have to think about it, but if there are multiple things that happen “at the beginning of the round” this describes the order in which they happen.\nIf there are multiple things that happen in the same sub-phase, you get to choose the order in which they happen.\n\n1. Effect Activation\nAny already active effects that trigger “at the beginning of a round” happen now. They happen before anything else in the round does. This includes taking damage from [poison] or [bleed] or gaining health from [heal]. If you have an effect active that causes you to do some sort of rolls or contests, do those now.\n\n\n2. Status Management\nAt this point any effect or mechanic that involves rounds passing is accounted for. AP is regained a, a point of [poison] is removed, a point of [heal] is removed, anything that would end at the “beginning” of this round ends now.\n\n\n3. Moves and Skills\nSome moves and skills get can be used “at the beginning of the round”. These can only be used after effects happen and then are managed and AP is regained.\n\n\nIncreasingly Complicated Examples\nSay you have 1 HP, 1 [poison], and an ability that causes [poison] to heal you instead of harm you which can be used at the beginning of the round. The order in this case matters, do you reduce [poison] by 1 first and avoid the damage? Can you use the ability before the damage from [poison] kicks in? No and no. First damage happens, then you remove the [poison], and then you can use an ability (though in this hypothetical you would already be at 0 HP).\nLet’s say that instead of having an ability that lets you heal from [poison], you already have an effect active that makes poison heal you. In this case you would heal 1 HP from the poison damage and then remove the poison.\nAn even more complicated example: let’s say that in addition to the passive healing [poison] effect you have an item that activates when you would take [poison] damage and nullifies the damage. In this case you have two effects that happen in the same phase, so do you heal from the poison or ignore the poison? In the case of this sort of tie, you get to choose. Presumably you would choose to heal which means the item would not be triggered because its no longer the case that you would otherwise take poison damage.\n\n\n\nMain Phase\nThis is where basically everything in the round happens.\nIf you want to do something, you say what you want to do. If multiple characters want to do something at the same time, the order they take actions in is based on their initiative. If there is a tie of two or more characters, the character that went most recently goes last, the character that went most recently before them goes second to last, etc. If several characters haven’t gone yet, roll a contest between them.\n\n\nInterrupting and [interrupt]\nIf you want to directly interfere with another character’s action roll an initiative contest. Spend (1n1) when you attempt to interrupt. If you win you act first. The opponent can still take their action afterwards. You cannot attempt to interrupt the same action twice.\n\n\nCoordinating Actions around the Table\nSay Alice has 3 initiative, Bob has 2, and both try to do something at the start of every round. Alice is faster than Bob and will always end up going before (“overruling”) Bob, but some time is wasted establishing that every single round. We want to minimize these sorts of predictable action-taking collisions.\n\nThe DM announces the highest level of initiative present according to the initiative tracker and gives those characters a chance to take actions. Once those characters have had a chance to act, the DM announces the next level of initiative and so on down the list. At the end of the list the DM should have a “last call” for actions and then announce the start of a new round.\nSlower characters can attempt to interrupt faster characters at any time. Characters can keep acting as long as they have the AP to do so, even if they already had a chance to take actions.\n\n\nUsing Only the Amount of Coordination that You Need\nIn the section above, all of the rules for initiative and when-exactly-effects-happen were explained, but often you won’t need to actively use all of these rules. It will probably be useful to make every step very explicit for beginners, but once players have a handle on how this system works, combat should be able to function without every step being made explicit, rules for determining who goes first can just be invoked when there is some conflict. You can choose to invoke rules for “phases” only when there are many effects that seem to happen at the same time and there is some reason why the order matters.\nAs an example, in a fight between two people the DM doesn’t need to be announcing the current highest level of initiative, there are at most two levels! The combatants will quickly figure out who is faster. The DM will often have to determine when the new round starts in combat, but this isn’t always true either. If there are only two combatants and they’re out of AP they can just agree to start a new round. Of course, the DM could still overrule them and describe something external happening that neither expected before they get a chance to start a new round.\n\n\n“Zooming Out” in Initiative\nIn the case of a tense duel between two arcane assassins that fill the air with daggers, poison gas, spells, and counterspells during their combat, a high degree of detail with regard to action priority and beginning-of-round effect activation is appropriate. Sometimes you do not want this.\nIn the case of a large fight between many characters, it can be appropriate to figure out an order based on initiative and give every character a turn, where in their turn they choose how to spend their AP and then they have to wait until their next turn. You might decide you prefer the game this way most or all of the time. That’s fine. Try a couple of different things, figure out what level of detail or orderliness fits your group or the context of the story and use that. Not every story or scene in a story will describe action in the same way."

    "text": "A weapon has a Speed, a To-Hit, and a set of basic attacks. The speed is how much AP it costs to do attacks with the weapon. The “To-Hit” is what you add to the check you perform when attempting to hit an enemy. This looks like “To-Hit: DEX” or “To-Hit: STR + AGI” or similar. To-Hit and Speed are both shared for all attacks a weapon has, but each attack can have different damage, different damage types, different effects, and different tags. The three basic damage types are (B)ludgeoning, (P)iercing, and (S)lashing.\nLet’s go through an example. Say the speed of the weapon is (2n1) and the To-Hit is +STR, it has one attack: “1d6+STR (B) eswinging: leading]”. When attacking with this weapon, you move 2 AP tokens to the 1 space and roll 2d6+STR for your To-Hit check. If that beats your opponents Defense, roll damage (1d6+STR) and tell the GM that the damage type is (B)ludgeoning.\nSome skills require attacks with certain tags like eswinging: leading] or they might only effect certain damage types. Some weapons will specialize in attacks of different types types. This captures how a rapier is better for quick piercing attacks than it is for slashes while a giant curved greatsword would be better at heavy slashing moves. A weapon like a rondel dagger (a long dagger with a narrow but thick blade) is able to ignore some armor and do pretty good damage with a piercing attack, but it will be a good deal worse at slashing than a kukri. If you’re in the jungle being attacked by big furry creatures, take a kukri. If you’re assassinating knights, take a rondel dagger.\n\n\nThe two major tag types are [thrusting] and [swinging]. [swinging] has three sub-types. Those three types are [swinging: following], [swinging: neutral], [swinging: leading]. The subtype refers roughly to “the position of the striking surface relative to the hand in a given swing” but this is much easier to understand through some examples.\n[swinging: leading] is the easiest to understand. It’s a swinging attack where the striking head is ahead of the weapon as in a warpick, an axe, or a hammer. The blade of the axe projects in front of your hand, it is “leading” the swing. These sorts of attack are typically slower and deal more damage. A (S) [swinging: leading] attack would be like swinging a meat cleaver or an axe, the wound from a [swinging: leading] (S) attack will be relatively short but deep. A [swinging: leading] (B) is like an attack with a hammer, a [swinging: leading] (P) attack is like an attacks with a warpick. You can expect to see attacks with any of the three damage types with this tag.\n[swinging: neutral] is the middle ground, attacks of this type will be faster than [swinging: leading] but do less damage. This is where the striking surface is in line with the hand as in a longsword (S), a quarter staff (B), or some sickles (P). You’ll see (S) and (B) attacks of this type most often. In general (P) damage is less common for [swinging: neutral] attacks.\n[swinging: following] is the oddest of the bunch. Attacks of this sort tend to be the fastest and weakest, relying on skills, conditions, or just an overwhelming flurry of attacks for damage. The central example of [swinging: following] is a curved dueling sabre. These attacks will nearly always be (S). You can construct weapons that have (P) [swinging: following] attacks, but they don’t make a huge amount of sense. What would a (B) [swinging: following] attack be? Maybe hitting a guy with the scabbard for your saber. Again, not very common. Magic abilities, skills, and exotic weapons can flesh out this category but there aren’t many historical examples of [swinging: following] besides curved swords and some glaives.\n[thrusting] includes thrusts with a spear, sword, or dagger. The vast majority of thrusting attacks have the (P) damage type.\n\nThese tags describe something physical about the weapon, “striking surface relative to swing” or just the motion as in the [thrusting] tag, but more importantly the tags describe the way the weapon is used for the attack. They describe how the attack feels, what kind of motion is done in the attack. A slow-ish sword with a slightly curved blade might still be counted as [swinging: neutral] if those are the sorts of attacks the weapon is made for, if that makes more sense for skills, etc. If you want more info about these distinctions and how weapons are made, refer to the Weapon Creation doc.\nOther weapon tags are possible, such as the [pulling] tag which belongs to scythes, some polearms, and hook swords. These are less important, and they don’t get their own glyphs, they exist for niche weapons and skills.\n\n\n\n\nDropping a weapon is a free action. Putting a second hand on a one-handed weapon is a free action, same for removing a hand from a weapon or any such minor adjustment, if in doubt TTYGM. Drawing a weapon is (1n1). Picking a weapon up off the ground is (1n1) and you’re [vulnerable] while you’re doing it, you can be interrupted with an attack while you duck down to grab a weapon. Putting a weapon away is (1n1).\nAn example: You want to drop your [two-handed] greatsword, pick up a handaxe from the ground, and draw your dagger. Dropping the sword is free, picking up the handaxe is (1n1), as is picking up the dagger. You’ve spent 2 AP, and you were [vulnerable] for a bit.\n\n\n\nIf you’re below a weapon’s requirements, you get no score based damage scaling (+SCORE) when using that weapon. Your max + To-Hit is 0 with that weapon. For every point you are below a score requirement, drop a damage die. If there is only one damage die left, make it one die smaller. If you get below d4 you cannot wield the weapon at all.\n\n\n\nIf you’re 2 STR above the requirements for a [two-handed] weapon, you can effectively wield it with one hand. If you use two hands on a [one-handed] weapon, raise your effective STR with the weapon by 2.\n\n\n\nFor every point you are below requirements for the weapon, reduce range by 2. Throwing a spear or dagger is (2n1), uses PERCEPTION and AGI to hit, has no damage scaling, 3 + AGI spaces for range. Drop a damage die from an attack to determine damage and damage type, if there is only one damage die, lower it."

    "section": "SOCIAL Rolls",
    "text": "SOCIAL Rolls\nNow for the least important part of playing a TTRPG, interacting with other people. This system is designed to allow a characters skills and stats to augment their social actions. The emphasis is not on getting good rolls, but on saying or doing the right thing. Rolls are used to express a particular character’s social talents, but they don’t replace the content of what the character says or does.\nA GM can use a check to determine success if they really do not know whether a given social action should or shouldn’t work on some character, and neither a success nor failure would be especially interesting. Even in this case, difficulty should be determined contextually. Grading numerical difficulty for a social interaction is generally difficult. A GM cannot prepare beforehand for the things a player will do or say, so DCs have to be set on the fly. Sometimes they are set incorrectly or something breaks. In this case, ignore the system/roll and do whatever is the most sensible/interesting/funny.\nSocial skills are divided into two sets: communicative skills and perceptive skills. communicative skills include persuasion, deception, and performance. Perceptive skills include sensing motives, detecting deceit, and gaining insight into another character’s emotional state.\n\nCommunicative Skills, Bias, and Reputation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n6\nRevered\nYou are seen as almost otherwordly, beyond reproach.\n\n\n5\nLoved\nYou are set apart from others, distinctly trustworthy, valued, and important.\n\n\n4\nAdmired\nYou are seen as an example to be followed, people will give your words great weight. They will go out of their way to help you out.\n\n\n3\nTrusted\nYou are trusted and valued. People will go out of their way to help you.\n\n\n2\nWell-Liked\nYou are liked quite a bit. People are willing to help you out. They want to see you do well.\n\n\n1\nLiked\nYou are liked. People want to talk and barter.\n\n\n0\nNeutral\nPeople don’t think much of you one way or another. They have the time to talk.\n\n\n-1\nDisliked\nPeople will give you bad deals in trade. They do not particularly want to talk to you. They do not want to barter.\n\n\n-2\nStrongly Disliked\nPeople do not want to talk or trade. They want you to go away.\n\n\n-3\nLoathed\nYou are a pariah. A group might throw you in jail, an individual might do you harm opportunistically. People will actively try to get rid of you.\n\n\n-4\nHated\nYou will be attacked. If someone is attacking you, they will be given help.\n\n\n-5\nDespised\nYou will be attacked on sight. There is probably a bounty on your head.\n\n\n-6\nReviled\nYou are vilified and reviled. Your name, face, and terrible actions are known. A group will send paid assassins and soldiers after you. An individual will go to great lengths and take on great risk and personal cost in order to do as much harm as possible to you.\n\n\n\nThe framework for setting a DC for a given social roll and the framework for reputation management are the same and they can be used in combination. Both systems share the same table of scores with rough characterizations of what each score “feels” like.\nThe scores range from -6 (“Reviled”) to +6 (“Revered”). These scores can be used by a GM to easily keep track of relationships and attitudes. They are also mechanical modifiers. If a character is at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”) with some group or individual, you treat their social roll as lowered by 2 (or you can just raise the DC by 2).\nYou can use these scores to set a sort of “default” attitude or bias for NPCs. The kindly innkeeper in a small peaceful town might treat every new person at around +2 (“Well-Liked”). The sneering guards in front of a keep might treat everyone at -2 (“Strongly Disliked”). Another traveler on the road just trying to get to where they’re going might be at -1 (“Disliked”) just because they really don’t want to stop and chat. The same traveler might, if you help them out, switch to +1 (“Liked”).\nThe purpose of social rolls is to be able to, in a given interaction, change the way people perceive you or interact with you. Remember that rolling checks with the SOCIAL score does not replace the content of what a character does or says, but just augments it. If a player passes the DC, treat their interaction as happening at 1 point higher than it would be otherwise. If the player exceeds the DC by more than 3, you can treat the interaction as being at 2 points higher than it would be otherwise.\nSay a player character is in a town in which they are at -3 (“Loathed”). Typically, this would mean that they are treated as a pariah, people are unwilling to talk to them and will actively attempt to get rid of them, they might be thrown in jail on made up charges. Guards will not come to their aid. If they are very charismatic they may be able to walk into a shop, attempt to talk the owner into selling them something and succeed by 4 on a roll. The shop owner thinks that the player character really doesn’t seem quite so bad, he thinks that maybe he is misremembering something or getting this person confused with someone else. He is still wary, however. He still treats the character as -1 or “Disliked”, he will tend not to want to barter, and he’ll want to get through the interaction quickly. Similarly, a guard treating everyone at -2 might be persuaded to relax a bit and just talk to the player character on neutral terms (-2 -> 0).\nOf course, there are plenty of things besides social interaction that might raise or lower someone’s opinion of you, and if the content of what a player character said is something that another character would naturally agree with or go along with, then no roll is necessary. Remember that the good will from one positive social interaction does not last forever. Actions will tend to have a greater effect for longer than words. If you just stabbed someone, you are not going to be able to smooth that over with your wit and charm, you do not even get to roll.\nThe table with specific characterizations is useful, but it can be boiled down to some rules of thumb. 0 is neutral. From +1 to +3 the character is favored. Persuasion, information gathering, and bartering will be easier. People give you the benefit of the doubt. From +3 to +6 people will go out of their way to help you, they will likely come to your aid in combat or follow you into combat. From -1 to -3 people dislike you and generally do not want to have anything to do with you. -4 to -6 is when you start seeing a lot of unprovoked violence.\nThis framework is largely for the benefit of the GM, to allow them to easily keep track of attitudes and relationships and to quickly create DCs and resolve rolls in a way that rewards the skills of the player as well as the skills of the character.\nThere are several different ways a GM can deal with this system in game. The system can be player-facing, that is to say, you could tell your players their numerical reputation among different groups or numerical values for the attitudes of various characters (along with descriptions). I do not recommend this. You could gate numerical information behind something like a good insight roll. This is fine, but even in this case you should lean on qualitative descriptions of how some character treats a player character. You can also keep the entire system completely to yourself, as a useful tool for the GM to structure descriptions and interactions. In this approach players do not get to actually know numerical values and you never have to reveal or justify movements in numerical values. This is probably your best bet. In this case the framework is still useful for figuring out how much the charisma of the character has helped the efforts of the player.\n\n\nSocial Perception\n“Social perception” is used here to refer to skills that allow you to roll to sense motives, detect deceit, and gain insight into another character’s emotional state. It’s important here to establish when exactly these skills are used and checks are made.\nWhen a player asks a question that would fall under “social perception” about another character, they should first be given a superficial description of the character and their apparent emotional state. If the character in question seems to be at ease, the GM should just say so. This is true even if the character in question is only pretending to be at ease, but plans to attack or betray the player’s character. It does not take a roll to be told that someone yelling and brandishing a knife is probably somewhat unhappy. The rules and skills for social perception are not meant to cover the superficial. These rules are for attempts to read another character. Social perception rolls are very similar to other character conflicts, they can be either a check or a contest. v ### Social Checks\nWhen the roll is a check, the DC will likely be a default DC of 6 + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills). If you are trying to read a character who is is lying the DC will be set by their initial attempt to lie, which will have been a check + SOCIAL (and/or relevant skills) against your passive social perception. If they attempt to lie and fail this check, then whatever they said will be described as highly suspicious or likely a lie. If they succeed in their initial check, but you pass their DC when you attempt to read them, you will notice that something seems wrong, or suspicious, or you’ll notice strange nervous habits.\nSocial perception rolls are almost always checks. If you are lying to someone, you perform a check. If they are trying to figure out if you are lying, they perform a check. If someone is trying to convince you of something and you think they might be lying, you perform a check.\n\nSocial Check Resolution\nIn the case of a tie, resolution is the same as any other check. Defender wins. Otherwise there are four possible outcomes.\nIf you pass the check more than 3, Complete Success:\nYou read the defender like an open book. You get a full answer to whatever question you were asking, or as full an answer as you could get from watching someone. They crumble at your gaze. Maybe they are so caught off guard that they fumble and make an embarrassing mistake, mentioning something they should not have.\nIf you pass the check by 3 or less, Moderate Success:\nYou get some insight into the question you were asking. If you are trying to see if someone is lying, you’ll know that they’re certainly not telling the whole truth, that they are actively misleading you. If you’re trying to get insight into someone’s emotional state, you get a good idea of how they are feeling. You might be able to tell that someone is distressed and trying to hide it. This is a pretty good read of someone, and they do not know that you know anything.\nIf you fail the check by 3 or less, Moderate Failure:\nYou have no answer to your question at all and the person you were attempting to read knows the vague shape of the question you asked or that you have a question. If you were trying to figure out if someone was lying about a specific claim they might know that you don’t trust them or that you suspect them in some way. Otherwise, you might just be staring and it’s weird.\nIf you fail the check by more than 3, Catastrophic Failure:\nGod have mercy on your soul. You completely give yourself away, your interests and your question are written all over your face. If you are trying to catch a lie, not only is it clear what exactly you think is being lied about, it’s clear that you have no idea if the defender is lying. Maybe you scoffed at a specific claim, maybe you blurt out “But the stone of Macguffin!” at exactly the wrong time. Your face is very red.\n\n\n\nContests\nContests are far rarer than checks. Social perception contests happen in contexts where it is understood that both parties are trying to advance their own interests and, if not outright lying, being very selective with the truth. Some examples of this would be a tense negotiation, an official dinner of ambassadors whose states are on the brink of war, a game of poker, spies meeting to trade secrets while not revealing their true intentions. In these cases checks would be happening simultaneously anyway, and the information that someone might doubt what you are saying or that they might not be telling the whole truth wouldn’t be very meaningful.\nContest Resolution is just about the same as check resolution. The difference between the rolls of the two characters determines which character succeeds and which fails, and to what degree. This success and failure are captured by the same event. For example one character might give away information they shouldn’t have, which captures both the success of one character and the failure of another.\nTies are just ties, a staredown, a tense silence. If your group prefers, ties can be resolved in the normal way for a contest: win goes to the higher modifier, if that’s a tie, it’s a tie in game, if that makes no sense, do it again."

Most of the time you will have two storage spaces:\n\nYour “personal” space, which includes anything you’re carrying that isn’t itself a storage space. Most often this would be your weapons and armor.\nYour bag. This is most often some kind of backpack.\n\nYou have a personal [encumbered] threshold. This is used for the weapons and armor you are carrying without a bag. Your personal [encumbered] threshold is 3 + STR. Your personal max encumbrance is 6 + STR encs.\nThe primary use of a bag is to give you more [encumbered] thresholds and to change your maximum encumbrance.\nBags have varying [encumbered] thresholds and max encumbrances. If a bag does not say it has an [encumbrance] threshold, then it never makes you [encumbered]. This is common for small bags that don’t have a max encumbrance high enough to be able to encumber, or bags that are designed not to encumber.\nRemoving a bag is (2n1).\nSearching a bag is (2n1).\n\n\nThe [encumbered] Threshold and Maximum Encumbrance\nIf you are past any encumbrance threshold in any storage space, you are [encumbered], you have the [encumbered] status.\nThe [encumbered] status lowers your move speed by 1. Your Defense is lowered by 3. Additionally, take a -1 to all AGI checks.\nIf you aren’t wearing heavy armor but you’re carrying enough in your bag to pass the bag’s encumbrance threshold, you are [encumbered]. Less obviously, this also means that if you are past your personal encumbrance threshold (most likely from carrying weapons and wearing armor that are too heavy for you to move freely with) but you are not past your [encumbered] threshold for your bag, you are still [encumbered].\nIn order to avoid passing an [encumbered] threshold you likely want to spread the weight around multiple storage spaces, keeping under all of their [encumbered] thresholds, or you might want to just put everything in a bag so that in a fight you can take it off quickly and not be [encumbered].\nYou cannot carry more encs in total than your single highest max encumbrance score. This does not mean that having one storage space where you can carry 8 encs means that you must be able to carry 8 encs in every storage space, it just means that all together you can’t carry more than 8 encs.\nUnless otherwise specified, you can only use one bag at a time. If some mechanic allows you to use multiple bags, you cannot carry in total more than your highest max encumbrance from a single source, though you can move encs around to try to avoid the [encumbered] status effect.\nYour [encumbered] threshold and your maximum encumbrance can be affected by status effects or skills, but most often they will be affected by the bag you are using."

There are parts of the character’s motivations, methods, and some mechanical details that have to be fleshed out in your game.\nYou’re a surgeon. You are absolutely convinced that by manipulating SALT you can revolutionize medicine. You will save countless lives, your likeness will be carved into stone, your name will be known by every medical student.\nHowever, your tests and studies require huge amounts of SALT to conduct. Others just don’t understand this or the importance of your work. SALT is an extremely valuable substance from the End, getting it transported to you while you were at the academy was incredibly expensive. You first got a hold of SALT by securing grants the old fashioned way. Of course, this did not give you enough SALT. The academy wouldn’t give you the funds you needed even though you were so close to an answer. Naturally, you took out loans that you could easily pay back once you finally made that breakthrough. You pawned your possessions. You lied, you went hungry, you embezzled obscene amounts of money from your department.\nUnfortunately, while you’re a great liar, you’re a terrible accountant. Soon after the discrepancies in the books were discovered and an investigation started, men were pounding at your door in the middle of the night. Thankfully, you’re a very cautious person. You always jam a chair against the door, you clutch your bag of SALT to your chest when you sleep, you sleep fully clothed. You downed the vial of SALT you always keep around your neck, felt the power of it surge through your body, jumped out of the window, and fled down the alley.\nYou knew exactly where to go next. You went to the source of the SALT. You turned east and set out for the End.\nYou’re a wanted now and you have no way of paying your debts. You’ve thrown away your career. You cannot return home. At least, not until proving them all wrong. You need to show them how they forced your hand, how they held back progress. You’ll show them why you did what you did and how the world will benefit.\n\n\nName:\nHP: 18, Defense: 6\nSTR: -1\nAGI: 0\nDEX: 2\nCON: 0\nPER: 0\nSOC: 2\nMED: 2\nHYL: 2\nScore Point Value: 11\n\n\n\nSALT skills: {salubrity}, {chitinous_strata}\nMED skills: {emergency_care}, {tend_to_the_wounded}, {triage}, {dissection}\nSOCIAL skills: {deception}x2\nSkill point value: 8\n\n\n\n1500f and 10 points of medical equipment in a {rucksack}. {rondel_dagger}.\n\n\n\nMore SALT. They want to continue their studies, how this actually works is something that should be worked out with the GM. Another thing you have to decide is how exactly this breakthrough is supposed to work. Is it a modified sort of SALT? Is it an ability for the surgeon to use?\n\n\n\nThis character starts with a lot of skills and scores, you may have to modify the character to fit your game. You can make them the equivalent of a graduate student or something, take away some skills, lower some scores."

    "text": "Character Creation\nCharacter creation allows you to modify the basic character sheet, add skills, create a backstory, choose starting equipment, etc. There are two primary ways of doing this, point buy and randomization. Point buy is the simplest and it uses the same mechanics that are used throughout the game to increase scores and buy skills so it will be explained first.\n\nDetermining Attribute Scores\n\nPoint Buy\nYou get some number of skill points (SP) to spend at character creation; how many points is determined by how exactly you want to start your game, TTYGM. Starting with 0 points to spend is good for a longer campaign where you want to start as entirely mundane commoners – you might even start with negative points. 9 SP is a good amount to start with to create semi-competent adventurers. Remember that you can spend SP on either scores or skills, the SP cost of a skill and any prerequisites are listed along with the skill.\nYou can lower a standard score to -1 to get a point out of it, you can only do this to 3 standard scores at character creation. \n\n\nRandomized Attribute Scores\nAlternatively, you can generate a random character by rolling dice for every score. You can decide with your group whether you want to go down your list of stats in order, starting by rolling to determine STR, then AGI, etc, or if you want to roll 6 dice and then be allowed to allocate them however you want. Choosing your allocation obviously makes it much easier to have a cohesive “build”.\n\n\nA Couple of Randomization Schemes\nTo determine stats at the start of the game, I suggest you either use d4-2 or d6-3. d6-3 is straightforwardly “better” than rolling d4-2. d6-3 is statistically equivalent to putting 1.5 SP into each score. If you are just rolling for the core skills, that’s a total value of 6 * 1.5 = 9. d4-2 is equivalent to 0.75 SP per score, or 6 * 0.75 = 4.5 (more explanation of this is in the Addendums section). Given that standard point buy gets 9, I would give randomized characters 4 or 5 points to spend on skills, depending on how competent you want your character to be right at the beginning of the game.\nI recommend rolling d4-2 to determine starting attributes. It gives characters a bit more room to grow and develop during the game. d6-3 will mean that you will likely get a 3 in some stat, which is so valuable it could quickly define your character before you’ve had a chance to play them."

Do you get advantage with a warhammer? What if you’re trying to use the pick side of a warhammer? Using the pick is the same motion as using the hammer, and its the same weapon, so shouldn’t you get the same bonus? Doesn’t it follow, then, that you should get the same bonus with warpicks? What if you find a sword with a forward curving blade so dramatic that the sword is basically just an axe with a hilt? Shouldn’t you get your axe bonus with that? This is without getting into the migraine that is “pole weapons” (poleaxe, bill, partizan, halberd, bardiche, glaive, pike…). This system allows us to neatly avoid the question of what weapon or what attack is axe-like or spear-like in some context or another and it allows us to avoid having a rigid taxonomy of weapons all while still engaging with the different advantages or features of different weapons. It also lets us create all sorts of goofy fantasy weapons without having to quickly change the taxonomy, all we do is describe how the fantasy weapon is built and the attacks you do with it and the weapon will work with existing skills and characters.\nIn this system we just describe the weapon itself and some basic qualities about the attack. A particular poleaxe is just a [two-handed] [shafted] weapon with [reach: 1-3] a particular Speed and To-Hit, and a couple moves. Maybe it has an axe head, a pick, and a spear. So it has a (P) [thrusting] attack, an (S) [swinging: leading] and a (P) [swinging: leading]. Maybe you have skills that work very well with axes, but you expect that this sort of multi-use weapon with a lot of reach might come in handy for hunting down a specific type of monster. You might choose then to take this pole-weapon with a relatively better (S) [swinging: leading] attack so you can leverage the axe-related skills you already have. This also helps us express skill transfer from different types of weapons. Your character is very good at two-handed axes and you find a one-handed axe that is really useful in some situations, maybe it applies some particular status effect. There’s going to be a lot of skill overlap, you just won’t get anything that requires [two-handed]. That’s all there is to it."

These rules are meant to be light enough that they should not slow the game down, but I want quickly go over why these rules are worth having in the first place.\nThese rules force players to make decisions about what they’re going to take with them and what they’re going to prepare for. Players and NPCs are very close to one another in HP and damage output in this game. The way you get an edge on someone else in combat is figuring out what your best option is given what you’ve prepared and the resources you have. The strength of most items and abilities are contextual, but this won’t matter or make the game more interesting if you can carry around a tool for every context.\nEncumbrance rules also add depth outside of combat. When trading with someone on the road, you have to trade with something you brought. If you’re delivering something to someone or hiding something, you have to keep it somewhere. These logistical questions should cause you to engage with the world like it’s a real place and make decisions about what you want to take with you and what you want to leave, what is important to your character and why. If your character is a rugged outlander that knows how to survive in the wilderness you have an important role in the party, you’re the reason the party is able to pack light and travel quickly, you’re the reason that the party can survive when you all run out of rations. There are many more opportunities for non-combat character decisions to be important.\nAll of this allows different weapons, items, and characters to shine in different contexts. This encourages different people in the party to take up different roles, acquire specialized skills, and adapt to the specific situations they find themselves in."

    "text": "I hate rules and I want as few of them as possible in my game.\nEvery mechanic and every rule introduced to a game imposes a cost. The game becomes heavier, slower, there is increased friction in every interaction. Let’s say you’re in a tense fight and you dive behind a crate before shooting at your assailants. Someone half-remembers a rule about half cover, or maybe this counts as full cover, how tall is this crate exactly? Someone else remembers that there is a rule about shooting from behind cover and anyway can you really take cover twice in a move? Shouldn’t you just shoot and then take cover? Or do you count as “in-cover” the entire time? And so it begins. The rulebooks come out. Your cool move that seemed totally reasonable as part of the fiction is being deliberated by the Supreme Court.\nI’m told that once everyone has spent long enough with a system everything really starts moving smoothly. That sounds plausible. More often it seems that everyone remembers slightly different versions of the same rule, at least two people disagree and the rulebooks come out anyway. Often tables end up just making something up that makes more sense contextually anyway. People who didn’t even know the rule existed would have done something that made sense contextually and moved on.\nObviously games like this need rules, but rules should help the game more than they hurt. That requirement should be enforced for every rule, especially small ones. Every rule should be simultaneously as modular and as load-bearing as possible. If a whole set of rules can be replaced by a framework or rule of thumb without hurting the game, even better. There are many ways of doing this. Rolling more dice or fewer, adding a score, whatever.\nSystems and rulesets in this game often look very similar and use the same minimal set of mechanics in order to try to and achieve this. They often cover a very broad set of situations. This should make it easy for a table to make up a context specific rule on the fly that will work just fine with all the other ones. This is also why numbers in the system tend to stay small, every point should feel meaningful. The shape of the 2d6 probability distribution is very useful for making small bonuses meaningful, especially small differences in bonuses. Going over that in more detail is for another time.\nI’m not going to talk about making good rules here because I’ve never made one. All I want to do here is explain my general dislike of single-purpose and specific rules, which is why try to avoid overly specific rules for specific situations. Sometimes this is hard to avoid. There is a rule for attempting to use two hands for a weapon that is [one-handed]. That is not all that dissimilar from cover, half-cover, or shooting from cover. Likely I will end up having to cut, add, change rules like that so that they won’t get in the way.\nI think the use of small rigid rules over broad reusable frameworks tends to shape the game into one that is built around the small rules too much. These rules corall players into coloring within the lines, thinking that the available options are only what there are rules for and not engaging with the actual place and world of the TTRPG. By overspecifying small things the tactility of the world is undermined. This is my attempt to find some set of rules that should only ever encourage players to engage with the tactile detail of the world."

This character somehow ends up in a sci-fi setting where TECH is a standard score, they went through a portal or something. It would be unreasonable to treat that character’s TECH score as 0 given that they’ve never even seen a computer. They should treat TECH as a [special] score or have a very negative score in TECH, say -5 (expressing that it would take them a good deal of work to get to the point where they can even begin to interact with technology). There is no rule that expresses this. It is expected that if you mix settings and mechanics in this way you will have some edge cases to iron out and you will have to make up some rules on the fly.

You can also just use summation notation (Σn).\n\n\nSome Basic Statistics for Making Your Own Randomized Character Creation Rolls\nAt a glance it might seem like d6-3 and d4-2 should be equally good. The expected value of a d6 is 3.5, so 3.5 - 3 = 0.5. EV of a d4 is 2.5, 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 as well, so why is d6-3 twice as good as d4-2?\nGetting to 2 in a score costs 3 SP (1 + 2), but getting to 3 costs 6 SP (1 + 2 + 3). Crucially, raising your score from a negative number always costs 1 SP, so if you roll a 1 on d6-3, you end up with -2, which is only equivalent to getting -2 SP (that is, you only have to spend 2 more SP than if you never bothered rolling at all) but if you roll a 6, you get a score of 3 which is worth 6 SP. High rolls are a lot more rewarding than low rolls are punishing at character creation.\nIf you want to figure out your own randomization schemes (that involve a single die) and what their equivalent average SP value is, doing so is relatively simple. First, you figure out all of the possible rolls. For d6-3, these rolls are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 (a roll of 1 - 3 = -2, etc.). Then find the “values” or SP you would have to spend to get that score for the rolls. For d6-3 these are -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 6. To get the average value, just add up all the SP values and divide by the number of rolls (because all of the rolls will be equally likely). In the case of d6-3, you get 1.5. Finally, multiply the per-roll-SP-value you just found by the number of scores you’re rolling for to see the equivalent SP.\nRemember that randomization means PCs will end up with characters whose scores are “worth” different amounts of SP. Finally, consider giving players some points specifically to buy skills with. Or don’t!"

    "text": "Alternative title that took too much space in the sidebar: “Do We Really Need to Know How Dextrous a Horse Isn’t?”\nAny scores not listed for a character are treated as being at 0. This works fine for humanoid characters but it quickly breaks down for a horse. A horse doesn’t have many relevant scores, so the reasonable and quick way to create a horse NPC would be to just list movement speed and maybe STR. Of course, this means that the horse has as much DEX as a normal person (0). Horses do not have thumbs, they don’t even have fingers. There’s a problem here.\nThere are a couple ways I considered dealing with this.\n\nGroup-Relative Scores\nMaybe a 0 here means that the horse is only as DEXtrous as any other horse. This isn’t too inelegant. Unfortunately, this is not how scores work anywhere else in the game. They are used in contests, so a 1 DEX mod should mean basically the same thing no matter who has it. Contests are not graded on a curve. This does not work.\nThis failed rule does gesture at another issue though. What it means for a horse to be agile (AGI) will be different from what it means for a person to be agile. If we grant that the base score system is on a human scale, how agile is a horse on that same scale? Is that a meaningful question?\n\n\n“Simple” NPCs\nMaybe a [simple] tag could be added to some NPCs. The score of any non-listed score for one of these NPCs could be considered -3, or automatic failure. Of course the problem here is that now one has to specify every score that might come up in a way that violates the goal of modularity. Also, it sucks. Surely the horse has more than -3 CON right? Maybe for an NPC that is simple enough this won’t be an issue, a horse can’t be expected to have a TECHNOLOGY score or whatever.\nThis isn’t a rule that contributes to the game and fits in nicely with the rest of the rules. It’s just a rule for the sake of having a rule.\n\n\nPreferring Not To\nRules are bad. An edge case like this should prompt one to reexamine the ruleset in question. If there is an elegant intuitive change that would make the rules more useful and expressive, then that change should be made. If there is a small rule or condition that fixes the edge case, rounds the rules out, and gives players some more options, then that rule should be put in place. Neither of those things seem true.\nWe could make people check more boxes when creating entities. Every score could come with a set of requirements. NPCs can be jammed into a typology where each type has slightly different rules and mechanics. When faced with ambiguity you can refer to rules for what a certain score means in a certain context in order to execute a predictable algorithm. Sounds crap.\nI call this DEX-rolling horse an edge case, but am I right about that? Yes. Is this really an edge case? Yes. There may be plenty of settings with lots of horses, but why would a horse be rolling a DEX check? How would you plan for that beforehand when creating the horse NPC? If you’re in a prison cell trying to get your tied up horse to quietly grab the keys and toss them to you, friend you’re in an edge case. The inconsistency that the original rule causes seems to demand some fix or a new rule. I would prefer not to create that rule. Just play the game, either the horse can’t make the DEX check or you just make up something that lines up with the tone of your game, it’s fine.\nIf you need more of a framework, the score is probably between 0 and -3 for this sort of thing. You could have the check made with one die. In a more serious game the horse just cannot make a DEX check. In a more goofy game the horse might make its first DEX check at -3, roll two sixes, pickpocket the key from the guard with his tongue, and now you’ve got a 2 DEX thiefhorse with a circus-related backstory and a quest for revenge against a clown named Bilphus.

You can generate text entries for entities while not doing anything special with templated {} sections and including them as-is in the generated text, or the tool can perform the rolls for you, or the tool can grab the entities within the templated sections, any entities within their templated sections, etc. It can do that recursive entity-fetching while also rolling dice at every step to determine the number of entities.

    "text": "What is a .yaml file and how do I edit it?\nA .yaml is really just a text file. You’ll want a text editor of some kind to edit them. Your system will come with some default text editor, when you try to open a .yaml your system should suggest using it. On Windows this is Notepad, on MacOS this is TextEdit, on Linux you already have strong opinions about text editors.\nSome text editors have autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and all sorts of bells and whistles to make your life easier, some are very minimalist. If you want to upgrade from your system default, I recommend (from less to more complex) Notepad++, Sublime, and Visual Studio Code. All of those editors are available on every OS. I use VSCode because of the available extensions. Quarto has a nice VSCode extension, I would recommend VSCode if you want to mess with Quarto."

    "title": ".yaml Entity Creation",
    "section": "Making and Editing .yaml entities",
    "text": "Making and Editing .yaml entities\nFirst, let’s get used to what entities in the .yaml files actually look like:\n- name: Machete\n  tags: one-handed, hilted, bladed\n  speed: \"(1n1)->(1n2)\"\n  to_hit: \"+STR\"\n  basic_attacks: \"1d6 (S) [swinging: leading]\"\n  flavor_text: A simple tool for cutting down brush.\n  encumbrance: 1\n  filter_tags: weapon, basic\n- name: Rucksack\n  effect: \"Max encumbrance: 6 + STR, [encumbered] threshold: 3 + STR.\"\n  filter_tags: item, bag, basic\nThe pattern here is pretty simple. Every entity starts with a name like this - name: Eater of Names. Then any other features that belong to that named entity are listed under it as foo: bar The two spaces in front of the feature are important. It says that the feature belongs to the same entity as the name does. This allows us to list many entities in the same file, like so:\n- name: Haver of HP\n  hp: 99\n  filter_tags: haver, npc\n\n- name: Haver of Flavor\n  flavor: >-\n    The Haver of Flavor leaves a strong impression. \n    It looks a certain way, it sounds a certain way, and it tastes a certain way, but it weighs nothing, does nothing, and can't be killed.\n  filter_tags: haver\nThe first thing you might notice about the above text is the >- in the “flavor” field for “Haver of Flavor”. These characters are just a way of telling the .yaml file a couple of things about the text it’s going to see next. It says that what is going to show up on the next indented section belongs to “flavor” and is a block of text. It also sets up a couple of rules. When there is one line break, that should be read as a space. If there are any more line breaks after the first, those should be read as normal line breaks. You’re also telling the computer to get rid of any trailing spaces or line breaks.\nThis is just a little trick to make writing long blocks of text easier without having line breaks added to the text. If we actually do want a line break in our text, we just add an extra line break! So altogether:\n  flavor: >-\n  The Haver of Flavor leaves a strong impression. \n  It looks a certain way, it sounds a certain way, and it tastes a certain way, but it weighs nothing, does nothing, and can't be killed.\nWill be parsed as:\nThe Haver of Flavor leaves a strong impression. It looks a certain way, it sounds a certain way, it tastes a certain way, but it weighs nothing, does nothing, and can't be killed.\nBut\n  flavor: >-\n  The Haver of Flavor leaves a strong impression. \n  \n  It looks a certain way, it sounds a certain way, and it tastes a certain way, but it weighs nothing, does nothing, and can't be killed.\nWill be parsed as:\nThe Haver of Flavor leaves a strong impression. \nIt looks a certain way, it sounds a certain way, and it tastes a certain way, but it weighs nothing, does nothing, and can't be killed.\nIf that seems annoying, you can just not use >- or similar little editing tricks, instead just write your text in one big line.\nYou’ll notice there is a line break between the two entities in the file. This is not for any technical reason, I just think adding a line break between entities makes the file more readable. Line breaks between entities are ignored.\n\nAvailable Features for Entities, What do Different Entities Look Like?\nThe full list of features an entity can have is:\n\nbasic_attacks\ncost\neffect\nencumbrance\nfilter_tags\nflavor_text\nholds\nhp\nname\nrequirements\nscores\nskills\nspeed\ntags\ntarget\nto_hit\n\nThese all have special rules for formatting, they can be changed if you want to plumb the code but you don’t need to.\nWhen you use entity generators (card generators, .md file generators, etc.) the features for the entity will be presented in whatever order they’re in inside of the .yaml. If you choose a weird order nothing bad will happen but the card might not look like other cards.\n\n\nWhere are the Entity .yamls, where should new ones go?\nIn the repo, the .yamls live in ./data/entities. There are a bunch of different .yamls for different sorts of entities, different groups of entities, themes, etc. This is just because they are easier to work on this way. This has no impact on the code. The code will just look in the folder and read every .yaml file present, it takes no note of what .yaml an entity is from. In the folder there is one special .yaml, templates.yaml. This .yaml has no actual entities in it, the only thing it contains are blank entity examples that have been commented out. These blank templates have all of the fields that the most complicated (typical) example might have. For example, this is the entry for a weapon entity:\n# typical weapon example:\n#\n# - name: \n#   tags: \n#   requirements:\n#   speed:\n#   to_hit:\n#   basic_attacks:\n#   effect:\n#   flavor_text:\n#   encumbrance:\n#   filter_tags: weapon\nLink here.\nIf you want to add to the .yaml files you can edit them directly. You can also make your own .yaml in the same folder and it will be picked up with everything else when data is loaded. If you don’t want something to be loaded, delete it or just move it out of the folder.\n\n\nfilter_tags?\nfilter_tags does what it says on the tin, it’s set of tags that people can use to filter entities that they see when generating text, cards, or when searching through entities. You’ll notice that filter_tags is the only feature that isn’t blank in the template. This is a weapon template so presumably it would have the weapon tag. If you want to print cards for every weapon you would just search for entities with ‘weapon’ in their filter_tags.\nThere is no restriction to the number of filter_tags an entity can have. You do not have to pick from a restricted set of filter_tags and you can add as many filter_tags as you want (though of course, common or relevant ones will be much more useful to people).\nThe filter_tags field shouldn’t be confused with the tags field. filter_tags are for searching and filtering, they have no in-game use. tags have in-game mechanical uses, they are things like bladed or two-handed. In the future this distinction might be cleaned up, but right now just remember that they are totally different things, you cannot filter by tags and you cannot use filter_tags like normal tags in-game.\nThe only strict rule is that multiple filter_tags should be separated by commas. The preferred style for filter_tags is all lowercase with no special characters. If you need to add a space, use an underscore.\nEntity type filter tags are very common and useful. These are invocation, item, npc, skill, weapon.\nThe most important filter tag might be basic. basic marks entities that any character should know about at the start of the game, these are explicitly not spoilers. The basic tag allows players and DMs to confidently generate a full list of spoiler-free content from any set of entities."

    "text": "What kind of game is this?\nThe base rules should be flexible enough that they can be modified to make many types of games. That being said, the setting, weapons, etc. presented in this site are used to make a game where the player characters are not inherently special. Player characters follow the same rules and use all of the same mechanics that NPCs use.\nThe game is about normal people making their way through a dangerous and fantastic world.\n\n\nTone and Goals\nThe world of this game is much bigger than the players and it moves without any concern for them. When players meet a creature there should be no expectation that they will be able to kill it. If players pick a fight they can’t win, that’s on them. Characters might lose limbs. They might die as a part of normal combat. The game is not built to make players straightforwardly more powerful over time, but that doesn’t mean they have no agency. Players have resources to advance their characters. If a player wants more health, they choose to spend their limited resources on health. The same is true for skills. Characters should grow in response to the pressures they face. Characters become better at what they try to do, they do not progress smoothly along a given plan. There are no classes and there are no levels. There is no destination. There are only small people and their unreasonable efforts and goals.\nThere are skills for fantastic magic powers as well as more mundane abilities such as quickly drawing a weapon, disarming an opponent, parrying a blow, and effective use of a shield. Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, different weapons have different AP costs, different reach. Some might be better at slashing than piercing. A player should think carefully about what they take with them and what they can do with it. The reason for the great historical variety of weapons is that different designs work better in different contexts and for different purposes. I’d like a game that lets you engage with that dynamic and expands on it with interesting and relatively light mechanics.\nIn general, the context a character finds themselves in at any point is hugely important. Say you have a very advanced knight-type character with all sorts of skills. He’s in heavy armor standing guard. There’s a relatively weak early-game assassin character who has specialized in stealth and sneak attacks. The assassin has a long thin dagger meant for slipping through armor. The assassin manages to catch the knight unaware, prepares his strike, and drives the dagger through his neck. The knight is probably dead. In a direct fight the assassin would have no chance at all. This, basically, is how balance is handled (or not handled). The quality of skills, weapons, and character types depend on context and creativity. If you’re that knight standing guard, you probably want to invest in your perception, you probably want someone watching your back. In general, you should be thinking about what other people might try, you should be thinking about your vulnerabilities and how you’re going to deal with them.\nCombat is not orderly. You should be trying to take every advantage you can find. You should be trying to break the game. The flexibility of the system should give you the freedom to engage with combat in whatever way seems fun or interesting to you. You can set up status effects and conditions to trigger very powerful moves, you can dodge and weave around attacks finding an opening for a critical strike, you can use illusion and deception, you can just make an unga-bunga character that wields a club made from a whole tree. This might be a weapon that was never meant to be wielded by a player character, but you have so many Giant Weapon skills that you can use it to completely flatten anything in your path. You could also just talk your way out of a fight or sneak around and avoid the interaction entirely. Set up distractions, traps, bribe someone so you find out your enemies weaknesses beforehand. The way that you deal with situations should be unique to your character and your skillset.\nAn old wizard beset by bandits doesn’t have 10 times as much Health as they do because he’s “a high level wizard”. He might have less health than they do. However, he has the tools and knowledge to make such an encounter trivial anyway.\nThere are games that are built to make you feel a lot more powerful than everyone else in the game world, games that are far better suited to playing out the story of a legendary adventurer who went from hunting rats to slaying dragons. This is not that game. This is a game about people exploring dangerous places, taking risks, and beating genuinely bad odds with quick thinking, preparation, and luck.\nOn top of all this, the game should be relatively rules-light. When rules show up they should add to the tactility of the world not take it away. They should give you more options, they should be easy to improvise and easy to improvise with. There should be no superfluous rules for “realism”. While there is a baseline of universal rules and mechanics, a player should largely get to choose what specific mechanics they use to interact with the world, whether that’s risk-reward mechanics, complex chained effects, AP cleverness, Big Numbers, thinking of the perfect illusion at the perfect time, or social charm. Players aren’t restricted to one class or the options in that class, they can combine skills and mechanics in any way they can manage.\nThese are a lot of goals in this doc. The currently existing game is an attempt at reaching toward those goals. Many of these goals are in a great deal of tension with one another. Let’s see how this goes."

You stand in the highlands at its foot with your back to it. You look back at the infinite horizon formed by the sky and the land below you. You then turn around to face the End again and look straight up to see another infinite horizon. This horizon is the line between the rock formations and hanging forests of the End and the sky, with mists and clouds dancing between them.\nThis journey is long, dangerous, and expensive. It means going right up to the limit of the known world. To go past this point, to go into the End itself is for the suicidally greedy, the desperate, religious zealots, and the insane."

    "text": "Pseudo-Moron’s Treatise on the forms of the Loric Writing System:\n[[These double brackets are author notes (by me, not the fictional author of the fictional letter), and single brackets communicate something about the textual document you would find in-game.]]\n[[The first part of this document is typeset like it would be in the original, except with English punctuation marks: in particular, left and right commas are parentheses. ¶ (pilcrow) would be the end of paragraph marker, and ∎ (tombstone) the end of text marker (I have used tombstone due to its use in English as an end of text marker as well). ␃ or ␄ (end-of- text, transmission control code representation characters) could also be used as the end of text character, if you were insane.]]\n[[In this world, ; is a text attribution marker. You can use it at the end or beginning of quotes, and you use it with your name at the beginning of letters you are writing, instead of signing at the bottom.]]\nMoron of Sabis;\nLavirnee–you wish to know what has come of my research in the archives to which you have sent me. Here is what I have found–\nLoric began (as far as we can tell–as far back as we can go) with Proto-Loric–which was only spoken. From this arose Old Loric–on which I shall not dwell. Old Loric (it must be known) was written in cursive, hugging close to an invisible top line–and without vowels–but with the longination dots. The only punctuation was the em dash (–) tho at that time it was written as (:–) and the recursive form now seen in rarefied High Loric was rarely seen – the space ( ) tho this was occasionally disregarded – and the veneration marks which were properly used for the names of kings and such and not just any proper noun.\n[[I have stopped doing our fictional punctuation system now because lazy.]]\nEventually, the wiseman Moron the Great invented both punctuation and vowels. Short vowels were, as they are now, written below the line and the ascended vowels were written above the line. The ascended form of the vowel, being not inverted like the short vowels, are seen as the canonical form for the shape of the letter, presumably because Moron first used diacritics to mark long vowels. The h diacritic was also added then, and the initial vowels and h clusters were written above an empty (null) consonant—although this was mostly thought of as not writing anything and writing the diacritic about that. He invented the period, the pondering, the confusion, the left comma and right comma. The silly period, its child the sarcastic period, and the end-of-paragraph and end-of-text period were later innovations.\nIt should be noted that Moron also created a sixth vowel diacritic, an explicit null vowel marker for when a consonant is not followed by any vowel. This is rarely seen anymore. He placed it above, like a long vowel, But either placement can be seen throughout history, when this form has been bothered to be used.\n[[fictional punctuation system again for the next paragraph]]\n(side note–please stop calling me Pseudo-Moron–i am not pretending to be moron–I simply have the same name. I am from the city of Sabis– where the name is still somewhat common. (I understand (in your part of the world) a man named Bartleby the Lapine ((bugs bunny)) popularized the sarcastic usage of the appellation (Moron) so the name is no longer common–but it is a name)).\nMoron’s ^ was actually a triangle of sorts with a very concave bottom, hence why the big vowel form introduced for printing has a crossbar (as well as to distinguish it from the big vowel mark /). For normal text, however, this fine detail has been lost to time—and indeed would damage the comprehension of the small mark.\nIn this period, the interrobang (‽) was invented [page missing] I hope that clears that up.\n[[This section has a number of new words in it, invented to describe the aspects of the writing system’s letterforms. They are not typos, but the terminology is not set in stone yet.]]\nThe print era led to a great shift in Loric, as the printing press introduced the straightive. Johannes etc Gutenberg of Loria’s original print form included a unifying, structural line over all marks and spaces, including the constants and the vowels and longination dots, which were also letterized (converted from diacritics to full, standalone letters) and monospaced with the same width as the consonants. Note: the consonants connect to the line, but the vowels and longations don’t.\nIn unlinated straigtive used by later printers, the top line was removed altogether. Another variant seen sometimes is semi-linated, in which only consonants receive the overline.\nThe fashion is, among the uneducated—and, unfortunately, increasingly in the offspring of the uppercrust—to backport the overline of linated straightive to the writing of cursive by hand, out of a misplaced piousness. The result is a cursive text with a completely superfluous and unsightly overline resting on slightly above the structural (invisible) line of continuity in the cursive writing. May this practice one day find ceasation!\nGutenberg printed with as many clarifying marks as possible, to make the writing as clear as possible to the audience, as they were not used to the new medium. However, as printing matured, many people began printing without vowels nor longation mark—as seen usually in handwriting. Some enterprising printers printed, by clever means, with diacritical punctuation (vowels and longation) inserted as it would be in cursive, and some even printed in cursive using advanced printing presses.\nAlso, straightive was sometimes written by hand by now, with overline and without line, and with or without vowels and longation.\nThe former circular or approximately-circular base form of the period, and all its derivatives, changed to a downwards-pointing triangle ▽ or the slimmer ∇ in the print era, to avoid ambiguity between the period, the o vowel, and the v consonant.\n[[These symbols are unicode approximations of debatable accuracy:]]\nThe fleuron ❦ and jovaun symbol 𝔊 were also codified in the print era.\n∎"

    "section": "Damage Augmentation",
    "text": "Damage Augmentation\nThe first thing any character wants in combat is to do more damage. They will want to pick up skills that let them increase damage, but how should their damage be increased? Here I’ve listed some of the mechanics that might be used for damage augmentation, pros and cons, and some potential interactions.\n\nAdding a Flat Number\nThis is stable but boring. I’m going to refer to “adding a flat number” as AFN in this section, because otherwise I write the phrase a thousand times.\nAt its best, AFN keeps a skill or advantage predictable. It works well with one-off sorts of skills, a +X when lying, a +X to disguise, as long as all of those flat plusses are large enough to feel impactful. The big problem with AFN is that because it is stable and unlikely to have unintended interactions its tempting to make everything AFN, but interesting interactions are a good thing. Flattening everything down to AFN makes the game a good deal more boring. A game that is riddled with +1s that players and DMs will forget about is AFN at its worst.\nRight now many social skills add +2 to certain rolls. It helps that they are all adding +2, rather than some at +3, some at +1. A +2 is a big deal when a complete success comes from passing a DC by 3, but +2 is not so impactful for damage rolls.\nMost of flaws with AFN go away if the boost is temporary. AFN should rarely show up in damage and in passive skills, especially those related to combat. It’s just not very interesting and it doesn’t interact with other skills meaningfully.\n\n\nAdding a SCORE to Damage\nAdding a SCORE is the more interesting Adding a Flat Number. Say you have a skill that lets you add your STR to the damage rolls of two-handed weapons. You could have another skill that raises your effective STR when wielding a two-handed weapon. If you get a two-handed weapon that already scales with STR you suddenly have a fantastic combination, you’re raising your STR and then adding it twice with every hit. You may find other items, invocations, and conditions that help you boost this even more. This is good, this is intended. Adding STR to damage will keep being useful in new ways and it opens the door for interesting interactions. Of course adding a score, like most of these damage augmentation mechanics, favors fast weapons.\n\n\nReroll a Damage Die\nThis can allow for interesting gambles but it requires players to make decisions about the attack and the damage even after the damage roll. This mechanic asks them to roll again when in general we’re trying to avoid wasting time with extraneous rolling. This should be used sparingly, if at all. The player has to remember to decide whether to use it and then they might have to redo some damage calculations. I’m not super interested in this. Outside of damage this might be cooler.\n\n\nMax a Damage Die\nThis one is very interesting and will cause some interesting problems down the line. I am gravitating toward making a lot of damage increase mechanics happen when one rolls the max on a damage die. Like a small crit. Doubling the damage of a die on max is normally relatively balanced, it’s a +1 to EV for a fair die. However, once you introduce maxing a damage die as a mechanic, mechanics like doubling on max or even just bigger dice become a lot more valuable. Is that a problem? Maybe!\nThis is a good clean mechanism for increasing the damage a player does but in combination with other damage mechanisms which activate on a max roll it might just end up defining every character that uses it.\n\n\nDouble on a Max Roll\nEV is +1 but it seems a lot more exciting than just a +1. With big dice like a d12 this could lead to massive damage. Maxing a damage die too easily can break this mechanic.\n\n\nExploding Damage Dice\nThis suffers from a similar problem that “Reroll a Damage Die” suffers from, it could mean extra rolling after the damage roll is already done. It slows down the game, so it’s alright for something like a sneak attack, but the mechanic should be used sparingly.\n\n\nInflict Status\nThis one feels very interesting to me, though let’s see if it ends up feeling good in a game. Inflicting a status could let you set up later moves and it can help players deal with really big enemies with damage over time. If players are whipping statuses with buildup around all the time, this could create a headache for the DM. The obvious statuses a player might inflict with a skill are [bleed], [vulnerable], and [prone]. There is no [stun] mechanic, but maybe there should be!"

This can be done with mundane skills like Sneak Attack, but it can be done even more easily for arcane combat abilities, a move that requires an enemy to have [curse] for example."

    "section": "Types of Armor",
    "text": "Types of Armor\nBefore I go over the different types of armor I want to quickly note that the quality of armor and the degree to which armor protects you will vary wildly, especially in a game where you can make up new and magical materials.\nI’m going to quickly go over some different armor types, examples, and mechanical implications.\n\nFabric/Textile/Padded Armor\nThis tends to be the cheapest, most common, lightest, and least effective type of armor. It tends to be better against bludgeoning, okay against slashing, poor against piercing.\n\n\nChain Mail\nTends to be excellent against slashing, okay or poor against piercing, and it tends to do little to nothing against bludgeoning damage. This tends to be fairly expensive and heavy but finding armor that fits is relatively easy.\n\n\nSemi-Flexible Armor\nThis category includes brigandines or any armor that consists of small rigid overlapping pieces attached to a fabric or leather structure, like scale armor. This is quite expensive and fitting this sort of armor is not very easy. Getting into this armor also takes a while.\nIt is excellent against slashing damage, and better at dealing with both piercing and bludgeoning damage than chain mail. This sort of armor is generally more balanced than chain mail.\n\n\nPlate, Fully Rigid Armor\nTypical medieval metal plate armor is extremely good at dealing with slashing damage, very good at dealing with bludgeoning, and though it might be worse against piercing, it’s still very good. Your best bet when fighting someone with plate will probably be to attack between joints or destroy the armor with heavy crushing attacks. You will likely need a specialized weapon to deal with metal plate.\nIt is extremely expensive, very heavy, hard to store, hard to put on, and hard to transport. Knights tended to require multiple animals and a squire. Full plate is a hard thing to balance a game around, and it was much more rare than you might have been lead to believe.\nGiven that this is a ttrpg, you can create more balanced sorts of rigid or plate armor, say something made out of giant crab shell or something. In this case, plate is still pretty good against every sort of damage, especially slashing, just maybe not as much as fine metal plate.\n\n\nThe Availability of Shields and Armor\nThe availability of armor and shields in your game is something to consider carefully. Not everyone needs to always be wearing some kind of armor all the time. Armor is expensive and cumbersome, it probably isn’t the case that every traveler you pass is wearing armor. If that is the case that should be used to say something about the setting and the world.\n\n\nMaking and Finding Shields and Armor / The Current State of Armor Creation / Notes Notes Notes\nWhen making shields and armor, some degree of randomness is useful to express the different qualities and condition of the armor. Because of armor breaking attacks, armor will not last forever. If you’re fighting through a long dungeon and you find armor in better condition than your hacked apart armor, you should probably switch.\nThere are not currently rules for armor fitment. Maybe there should be. There are a couple okay-ish options that I might list here later, but nothing has seemed quite good enough.\nBecause specific values matter less for armor and shields and the range for damage reduction is smaller than the range for weapon damage, specific examples of shields and armor are generated from a set of rolls and modifiers. Often but not always this includes some minimum damage reduction. More guidelines should come later, but again, armor has had a lot less testing done than weapons."

The first is in the “Tags” section which includes general information like whether the weapon is [one-handed], [two-handed], [hilted], etc. The second place information is stored is in a given attack, a spear might have an attack that is [thrusting] and does (P) piercing damage.\nPutting these together, a handaxe is a [shafted] weapon with the [one-handed] tag that contains a [swinging: leading] attack that deals slashing (S) damage. Skills might require a certain damage type or a certain tag, but they won’t require the use of an axe or a sword. The system has no opinions about what exactly qualifies as an axe or a sword. The system only describes relevant features of the weapon and what you can do with it.\nWhy do this? In history (and in various fantasy settings) people did not restrict themselves to making weapons that fit cleanly into one category. Pole weapons were given all sorts of hooks, blades, points, and hammer heads so that they might fill a specific niche at a specific time. Swords were created that specialized in heavy cleaving strikes, like a khopesh, or thrusting through gaps in armor, like an estoc. Swords were created in all sorts of lengths, profiles, weights, and guards so that they might be lighter, easier to travel with, better against armor, better on horseback, have greater reach or be easier to conceal. I’d like a system that captures those different tradeoffs, designs, and functionalities while also being intuitive, easy to use, and lightweight. It shouldn’t be the case that a character just holds on to the best plussest sword they’ve found so far. Players should be thinking about what they might expect to face or what practical tradeoffs are best for their characters.\nSkills might capture a proficiency with a broad category of weapon like [one-handed] or [two-handed], but they can also get a lot more specific. A skill can describe the ability to do a devastating cleaving slash that destroys armor. This skill would augment a move with [swinging: leading] (I’ll get into what specific sorts of tags mean in a later section) that does slashing (S) damage. This cleaving skill seems like it was probably made with axes in mind rather than a rapier or a spear, and as you’d expect neither of those weapons have moves that are compatible with the skill. However, both a meat cleaver and a khopesh do have moves compatible with the skill. This should make sense. With its forward curving blade, a khopesh resembles an axe in its intended use much more than it resembles a rapier, though a rapier and a khopesh are both “swords”.\nThis emerges from how we describe a khopesh and how we describe the move. The person who made the move doesn’t have to have any idea what a khopesh is, the person who made the khopesh doesn’t need to know about the existence of that particular move, but a player who has been using nothing but [two-handed] axes for a month might find the [one-handed] khopesh and realize that it plays to their strengths and allows them to branch out, maybe they expect to face a lot of ranged weapons for a while and they would like a large shield in their off-hand. Maybe they just think the khopesh looks cool or the khopesh has some magic property that works well with a spell they know.\nRather than building tables, lists, references, or saying that some weapons are “axe-like” or “straight-sword-like” and constantly dealing with historical and fictional edge cases I’ve decided instead to attach a stable set of tags to weapons and moves as those qualities come up. Separating moves like this also allows some weapons to be able to both slash and stab but be relatively better at one move than the other."

    "section": "Broad Tags Based on Weapon Construction",
    "text": "Broad Tags Based on Weapon Construction\nThis category includes any tag that is not move-specific. There are no strict requirements or restrictions here, weapons don’t necessarily have to be described with some minimum number of tags from the standard set I’ll describe. No tags are inherently mutually exclusive, a weapon could quite easily be made that is intended to be used either [one-handed] or [two-handed] and has both tags. Though there are not strict requirements, there are basic tags you will see over and over and when making a weapon, you should almost certainly introduce some of these basic tags so existing skills will work well with the weapon.\nYou do not have to express every effect and quality purely through tags. You can specify different conditions or behaviours in the text of the weapon or along with specific attacks.\n\n[one-handed], [two-handed]\nThese tags capture what you would expect, whether a weapon is meant to be used with one hand or two hands. There are generic rules in the main rules document that allow someone to two-hand a [one-handed] weapon that they might not have the strength to wield, or one-hand a [two-handed] weapon. Most weapons will be built to be either one or two-handed, but some will be designed to be either one or two-handed like a bastard sword. This sort of weapon should be created with tradeoffs in mind. The bastard sword is between the two categories, not quite as fast as a dedicated one-hander, not quite as hard hitting as a dedicated two-hander. When building a weapon like that you can just add both tags so skills for either one or two-handed weapons could be used, or you could specify some different behaviour or effect when the weapon is used with one hand or two.\n\n\n[range: X]\nThe range of a weapon is the number of spaces away from you that you can attack. If no range is included the weapon is treated as being [range: 1]. [range: 0] is a special case. When using a [range: 0] weapon like a dagger or brass knuckles you are treated as moving into the enemies space during your attack and then back out again, though some skills may allow you to fight your enemy within their space which might be advantageous for you. [range: 3] is assumed to mean all the spaces up to 3, i.e. [range: 0-3]. If this isn’t the case you can specify the low end of the range. An especially long pike might be [range: 2-4], so that it is completely unusable at close quarters. If you want to specify some specific disadvantage or advantage from range just include the range and then describe that in the weapon text.\n\n\n[hilted], [shafted], [flexible]\nThis is a pretty important category. [shafted] weapons are any weapon that consists of a head mounted on a shaft or pole. Rather than having some set of unambiguous places for one’s hands, they have a length along which any place is a valid handle. Axes, every polearm, staves, and spears all fit in this category.\n[hilted] weapons do not necessarily need a pommel or a guard, their defining feature is having some unambiguous place or set of places for the hands. You are not necessarily meant to slide your hands around when using these weapons. All swords and knives fit in this category, even what is typically called a “zweihander” with its ricasso and parrying hooks fit in this category. In the case of the zweihander you may have more options of where to grab the weapon, but you do not have one large continuous handle as in an axe. The zweihander has distinct set of grips, so it counts as [hilted].\n[flexible] weapons are a pain. There are two general categories of flexible weapon: [flexible: flail] and [flexible: whip]. [flexible: flail] includes any flexible weapon with a striking body at the end such as in a pinyin, hussite flail, or in a simple one-handed flail with a ball and chain. [flexible: whip] includes any flexible weapon without a striking body at the end, such as a whip, or an urumi.\nA weapon is typically only one of [hilted], [shafted], or [flexible]. That being said, there is nothing besides human decency that would keep you from making a swordspear with a ball and chain attached to the shilt (similar to how the flail is attached to the kusarigama). I cannot stop you. I wish I could. You could even make it [one-handed], [two-handed], and completely unusable. In general, resist the urge to create a platypus because it has as all the tags, most weapons in history did not look like that because having all that extra stuff makes the weapon a clumsy mess. It doesn’t show up in fantasy because it’s ugly. But you can still do it."

You should give a range for a ranged attack, and if the attack is a [ranged: throwing] attack you should say so.

    "section": "Requirements vs Scaling and a Note on Weapon Sizes",
    "text": "Requirements vs Scaling and a Note on Weapon Sizes\nWhen in doubt use requirements to balance weapons instead of score based damage scaling (+SCORE to damage). Fast weapons should very rarely get score based damage scaling. Slower weapons should be much more likely to get score based damage scaling. In general (but especially in the case of faster weapons) score based damage scaling should be a remarkable feature of weapon, not a standard part of an attack. It’s totally fine for weapons of a higher quality to be straightforwardly better than simpler or more common weapons.\nVersatile weapons (that is to say, weapons that are good at multiple types of attacks, and don’t necessarily specialize) like straight swords do not generally scale with stats, they just have higher requirements. There are skills for more advanced characters to use to do more damage, this is where most extra damage should come from. Some weapons like hammers might add STR to damage, and many ranged weapons might add PERCEPTION or DEX to their damage, but their base damage is lower to compensate. For these weapons, the idea is to express that relatively more of the damage comes from how hard you can swing the hammer or where you place your shots.\nOf course, where you hit with a sword matters too, but it’s not considered to be the main component. The reason for this admittedly arbitrary distinction is mostly a mechanical one. Let’s say you add STR scaling to a weapon. You can expect most players using that weapon to have 2 or 3 effective STR. The expected value of a die where the max roll is x is x/2 + 0.5, so the expected value of a d6 is 3.5. If you add DEX damage scaling to a weapon that does a d4 for damage and the player has 2 DEX, then the expected value is 3.5 + 2 or 5.5, the same expected value from as an attack from a d10 weapon, this is a huge jump.\nAdditionally, adding scaling is a much bigger deal for faster weapons than slower weapons, as attacking three times with a weapon that has +DEX scaling means you add it three times in that turn, so if you had 2 DEX you’re suddenly doing 6 extra damage, or equivalent to an exra d11. Slower weapons and two-handed weapons already have the disadvantage that they eat up more AP, restricting your options within a move. You can also just miss your one attack with a slow weapon, and with a two-handed weapon you don’t get a shield or anything else in your offhand. Damage scaling can be used to combat this, giving players more of a reason to use larger slower weapons, especially if it plays to their strengths. You’ll notice that generally [two-handed], slower, larger weapons generally do more damage per turn than smaller, faster, [one-handed] weapons, this is intentional. As explained above, smaller faster [one-handed] weapons already have a lot of advantages and flexibility. [two-handed], slower, larger weapons generally need more features and more damage to balance them out. When making a larger weapon, you have to include mechanics and features to try and express the advantage of having more reach and more power than your opponent."

Be aware that adding flat damage raises the expected value of the damage by more than you would expect, 1d6 + 2 is equivalent to 1d10.\nA giant club with spikes might be 2d6 (B) + 1d6 (P).\nIf a weapon deals multiple damage types, both damage types are affected by armor separately. That is, if there is armor that blocks 4 (B) and 2 (P), you attack with the club that deals 1d6 (B) + 2 (P), and roll a 5, you do 1 damage in total, so doing multiple damage types in one hit is a bad bet against armor, though it might just be free damage otherwise.\n\n\nOne-handed examples:\n1d4+ (light), small weapons, dagger, shiv, small club, push dagger.\n1d6+ (light-medium), smaller weapons, aggressive scaling weapons (+2*Stat), finesse weapons with scaling, hatchets.\n1d8 (medium), normal sword, club, lightly scaling weapons.\n1d10 (medium), high quality weapons, martial weapons.\n1d12 (medium), very high quality weapons.\n\n\nTwo-handed examples:\n1d10, 1d12 (light-medium), low quality weapon or aggressive scaling weapon.\n2d6 (medium), typical two-handed weapon.\n2d8 (medium-heavy), high-requirement two-handed weapon, high quality.\n3d6, 4d4, 2d10 (heavy), high quality, heavy weapons.\n3d8 (heavy), giant weapons."

Damage roll, damage type, then any tags. “A large iron head fastened to the end of a simple hardwood shaft.” <– A brief description.\nThere are plenty of skills that one can use with this weapon, such as Defensive Perimiter. You do not have to call that out in the description. Striking with the butt end of the spear does not have to be included either, though it is something a player could do.\nNow without notes.\nSpear Tags: [one-handed], [shafted] Speed: (1n1)->(2n1) To-Hit: +AGI - 1d8 (P) [thrusting] - “A large iron head fastened to the end of a simple hardwood shaft.”\nNot every spear needs to look like this. I choose to not give it requirements, give it a solid d8, make it a bit slower than a comparable sword, and describe it as a simple stout spear. You could create a lighter [one-handed] spear with a d6 damage die, make it a bit faster, and give it a [range: throwing] ranged attack. Maybe it’s of higher quality, and it does all this while getting a d8 (try to avoid doing this too much to avoid power creep).\nYou can go the other way and create a heavy [one-handed] spear, here I’m going to use the historical example of the pilum.\nPilum Requirements: 1 AGI, 1 STR Tags: [one-handed], [shafted], [reach: 2] Speed: (2n1) To-Hit: +AGI - 1d10 (P) [thrusting] - AGI+PERCEPTION To-Hit, 1d12 (P) [ranged: thrown], [range: 3+STR]\nIgnore STR armor in melee, 2*STR armor when thrown.\n“A heavy throwing spear. The narrow pyramid head is mounted on a long iron shank.”\nPilum historically came in a wide variety of lengths and weights. They all had a long iron shank, they tended to be heavy for a throwing spear. Some controversial theories say that the thin shank was meant to bend down after the head buries itself in the opponent’s shield, making the shield much less useful. If you think that’s a cool mechanic, add it into a pilum or some other thrown weapon. maybe the pilum requires a high STR check and a lot of time to remove from a shield and while it’s in the shield the opponent can’t use shield skills, their movement or AGI is lower while they’re carrying it, something like that.\nThe pilum seems like it was designed to punch through armor, so it ignores some armor on hit. You’ll notice that the thrown move is quite strong, a d12 for a one-handed weapon. This was done for a couple reasons. First, the pilum is a specialized military weapon, meant for throwing at short range at an armored target, it should be very good in that context and it shouldn’t be terribly common. Second, it is very slow at (2n1). Throwing the pilum is probably all you are doing in that turn. This is a good weapon, and in a certain context against a certain sort of enemy at a certain range, it can be really exceptional. However, once you throw it it’s gone, and throwing it is going to take forever. A character might decide to throw it at the beginning of a fight, right before melee range and then get out their main weapon. This happens to be how the pilum was likely used. The point is not to make an extremely powerful weapon a character will definitely pick up and use for the rest of the game, nor is it to make an ideal historical simulation. Instead, just capture what it is that sets this weapon apart from others.\nNow for something less serious."

Only the thing’s gumless wheezing mouth is visible. The pages covering its face are of all sizes. They are small cards, letters, entire scrolls, they are made of ancient papyrus and fine white cardstock, they are clay tablets, leaves, scalps, hides. Covering these records are handprints, wild script, dead languages, moving glyphs, bright red blood, every form of marking. Curdled black fluid oozes lazily from around the stack and down the front of the its atrophied body. It is fat and weak. It smells like mildew. It sits hunched over a thin table. It wears a collared shirt.\n\n\nFirst Encounter\nIt’s friendly. It asks questions about superficial qualities, name, eye color, height, etc. Then it starts asking innocuous questions about both the subject’s current state and some recent events the subject has experienced. It knows things it should not know. It requires answers from the subject, it requires that information is confirmed. As the conversation progresses it asks increasingly meaningless semantic questions. The questions become more invasive. It to asks its questions while darkly hinting at terrible consequences should the wrong answer be given. It asks the subject to pick from a set of nearly identical options. It is patient. It is meticulous.\nAs answers are given, it will tear out a stake from its pale flesh. The stake might be a pen or it might just be used as one. It patiently records what is said. It asks the same questions over and over in slightly different forms, explaining how the questions are different when challenged.\nIt will insist that the subject is lucky to have run across the Bureau when they did, otherwise their debts and obligations may have grown to catastrophic proportions, now at least the subject can take control.\nAs the stake runs out of ink the Bureaucrat will drive it back into the wound to refill it. As the interaction progresses it will insist that the subject take certain forms and pens, filling out the forms, recording and reporting their actions, submitting the forms. It will insist that, to better make sure the forms are tracked and kept safe, the subject must allow the creature to attach the form directly with a small pin. Just a small note to be attached with a small pin, a convenient magic that allows the subject to never misplace the form.\nThe more information a subject gives and the more a subject engages, the more power the Bureau has over the subject. The Receptionist might first appear when the character is weak or in need, offering a service, information, or healing. It never specifies what it wants in return, if asked it will give a long explanation about how the service is not only free but it also entitles you to unspecified future services, advantages, and “opportunities”. If pressed it might admit that yes there could be some minor service fees but these are merely a formality, they can be waived or some arrangement could be found.\nThe Receptionist is after two things, information and some reason to be involved. It wants the subject to be visible, registered, quantified. It wants a confirmation of some instance in which the subject was wronged or perhaps wronged another. It wants the subject to accept some aid from the Bureau or accept some deal with the Bureau. The Receptionist is almost always the first member of the Bureau that any given character meets.\n\n\nOther Mechanisms\nWhen faced with a Receptionist the best move is to say nothing and kill it where it sits. This will make an enemy of the faction unless it is done from stealth or in some other way they do not see or cannot understand.\nThey cannot see art, it is literally invisible to them, its effects unknowable. Because of this it is not uncommon for illiterate travelers to carry books of poetry in order to beat to death Bureaucrats that appear in front of them.\nThe body of a Bureaucrat is good as a source of cheap ink and kindling."

The bones do not lie, they persist long after life, but they do not cling to the soul. The skin does cling, if only weakly.\nThe Harvester’s mind howls with the whirling souls of his victims, trapped under his skin. Harvesters carry large cruel bludgeoning weapons to kill or incapacitate while preserving the skin. They carry razor sharp sickles and knives, peelers with which they flay the living or recently deceased. They eat their victim’s skin, trapping the soul before it leaves the body. They worship the Flayed God who is said to have been a man who ate a thousand great souls before eating his own skin and ascending to Godhood. As they consume they grow more powerful and more mad. They are hated and feared by anything that might become their victim. Bugs, funginids, and constructs are often accused of working with them."

Their body constantly produces SALT, so they have to constantly burn SALT to stay alive. Having a lot of SALT makes them near superhuman, having little cripples them. They must always stay awake, SALT buildup would kill them in their sleep. The solution to the exhaustion and mental toll of their sleeplessness is burning more SALT. This abuse of SALT wears them down mentally and physically, a side effect that can only really be addressed with, of course, even more SALT. Their dependence on SALT tends to outpace their production, and they live in a frantic search for more.\nTheir fingers are sharp clumsy daggers of salt. Their limited hand mobility makes them poor with most weapons. When they fight, the increased production of salt armor covers and envelopes their hands, so they fight “unarmed”, with enormous spiked fists made of salt. In combat most are terrifying incoherently screaming superhuman brawlers in grinding mineral plate armor. Some rare crust punks can burn their salt by moving very quickly, cutting with enormous katars fused to their closed fist during combat. They cannot use armor, it just constrains their natural shifting salt armor.\nSome crust punks are miners who rejected a life of toil, preferring a short brutal life of glorious combat. It’s common for powerful or sloppy crust punks to die crystallized by their own continuous salt production, leaving behind a sparkling statue.\n\nGameplay Note\nPlayers might be able to learn unarmed techniques (including with brass knuckles, push-daggers) and improved physical augmentation through salt from them, but more likely they’re going to get jumped by a bunch of crust punks who beat them and take their SALT."

    "text": "The Isopods are an ancient people with courts, politics, philosophy, and dynasties. They can communicate through writing and speech. They can bypass language entirely to communicate complex feelings and even full thoughts directly to one another via pheromones. They do this instinctively, like a person moves their face.\nThe Isopod word for what we would call thought is approximately “inner thought” where pheromones are “outer thought”. Their word for themselves is approximately “thinker”, whereas their words for other groups relate the members of those groups to objects.\nIn the ornate and ancient Isopod courts, richly painted Isopods attempt to subtly manipulate each other by precisely deploying pheromones, even using bottled pheromones to mislead and persuade. They might strategically steer the mood of a room through highly trained covert manipulators though an Isopod gentleman would never admit this.\nIsopods view life in the caves as beautiful, ancient, and harmonious. In the caves their pheromones are not tossed to the wind as on the surface. It seems natural and just, then, that the underground should be so vast and varied where the surface is merely the end of useful space. They believe the world must be a sphere, as a sphere would maximize underground volume while minimizing surface area. They find it tremendously convenient that when a form of life is meant to be eaten they generally have their hard structure on the inside which could only serve the purpose of making them more suitable as food. They see their ability to speak to lower life as a great convenience, like being able to order around your coat rack. They are not a religious group generally, so a question their philosophers must grapple with is “Why, if there is no God, is the world so just?”\nIsopods also have philosophy on the nature of being and consciousness. They hold that, because they can directly communicate and transfer thoughts and emotions, they can verify and understand the experience and the consciousness of other Isopods. Groups that do not have this ability cannot meaningfully be said to be conscious. Most isopods think of mammals and similar as a sort of automata, not capable of any true thought or complex socialization. They are not generally hostile or even rude to mammals. To mistreat a lower life form would not be immoral per se, but it would be tremendously gauche. If you tell an Isopod your name, say “Tod” and it has reason to remember your name, it may refer to you as “It Calls Itself Tod”, though this is typically shortened to “itsa Tod”.\nIsopods converse in great halls built into the cave along the ceiling and on the walls as well as on the floor.\nIsopods once ruled the earth and they believe their time will come again. They are one of the oldest forms of life, persisting largely unchanged through time.\nThey have mixed views on other bugs, depending on their ability to communicate.\nThey absolutely revile the ants and would see them exterminated. They read what primitive “pheromones” the ants create as a sort of repugnant malignancy below the level of thought. Their hate and fear is magnified by the growing numbers of the ants."

    "text": "Isopod Anatomy, Movement, Fighting\nIsopods have thick layered bands of chitin along their top side. This forms their natural armor. They have seven pairs of jointed appendages. Each appendage ends in two articulated long sticky fingers. The two front pairs of appendages are the longest, with long fingers meant for fine manipulation. Lacking thumbs, the Isopods use their arms in vertical pairs with the two suspended top fingers and two suspended bottom fingers working in tandem, each finger opposable. The appendages after the foremost pairs become shorter and their main purpose shifts from manipulation to movement. They move low, using all of the limbs that line their body. They move parallel to the ground, with the bulk of their limbs folded under them. Isopods are larger than humans, though of course they are shorter when walking. They do not call their movement “crawling”.\nThey will tip their front portions upward in only a couple of situations. The first is when engaged in some especially demanding manual task where lifting something in front of themselves using only a couple of limb pairs will not suffice, as in the use of most of their instruments. The second is when in a posture of deference or trust.\nThey fight primarily through quickly throwing out rope darts or barbed blades with their long powerful fore-limbs and then either retracting the projectiles or attaching the ropes to the surfaces of the cave, suspending their victim from multiple points. They do this while moving rapidly along the cave walls. They employ long specialized patas and katars in close combat. They use nets to slow down their enemies."

Its shapes are highly varied, the colony that comprises its body improvised out of the bodies of found, slain, caught, or purchased creatures. It can be a mindless mass of claws or a giant psychic centipede of cobbled together human limbs and faces. Its entire body is a fungal colony.\nTo create a Legion, roll d20s. Decide beforehand how many Legions you want and of what size.\nFor every d20 rolled in its creation, the Legion gains a size category. 1: small. 2: medium, 4: large, 6: giant.\nEverytime the d20 lands on 20, raise the Legions intelligence.\n0: As a stupid rabid chimp.\n1: Single words, sentence fragments.\n2: It speaks as an intelligent hivemind, pulling information, preferences, and memories from the intelligent creatures it has consumed. It flits between personalities during conversation.\n3: It is hyper-intelligent, capable of inscrutable magic, a powerful being comparable to a sage, a demigod, or a great demon, depending.\n4: As a minor deity.\nFor every 10 health the legion has, roll:\n1d4-1 limbs\n1d4-1 stat points, can be put in any stat that any creature it has consumed has possessed.\nWith no legs a Legion can roll at 2 spaces per move. Every leg gives it 1 extra space of speed, up to 6 legs. Up to 10 legs it gets another 1 space per pair.\nNon-leg limbs can include stingers, arms with hands, claws, pincers, torsos reduced to short spines with jaws mounted on the ends, etc. Just grab attacks from other enemies at random.\nRoll 1d4-2 for every 10 health the Legion has. The Legion has that many exposed organs randomly placed along the outside perimeter of its space. The organ can be targeted for double damage with Called Shot. If a called shot is performed doing over 8 slashing damage, the legion loses that limb, (3n3 to reattach).\nLegions take double damage from fire and take a max of two damage from piercing attacks (unless performed on an organ).\nWhen a Legion’s HP is reduced to 0, it can no longer move or function.\nRoll one fewer d20 than was used to create it. For every d20 rolled, the Legion has a day to reform. Every day it rolls a d20 to regain health. If it hits half health within the time allotted, it can reform. If its parts are scattered they might reform as smaller Legions, DM discretion. Reformed Legions retain their memories. Burned portions of the Legion are fully dead. Players may try other means to fully neutralize remains.\nLegions are generally hostile. They are driven by the desire to consume enough to grow larger, more powerful, more intelligent. They have to consume many times the amount of mass another creature of their size would have to. Legions do not need sleep. They are constantly hunting and eating. They hold grudges.\nGiven that they prey on everything they are universally hated. That is, of course, unless they grow large enough to become powerful allies. They are extremely difficult to eradicate. Their invisible spores hang in the air waiting to colonize the sick or recently deceased. There are whispered stories of those who, in a desperate bid to survive, seek a symbiotic relationship by cultivating Legion within themselves. There is no documented case of this working."

You won’t be trying it all of the time on everyone, social rolls should not be able to replace social interaction. It should be the case that in many situations, rolling is a bad idea, not just unnecessary.\nCatastrophic failure sets up the possibility for characters or NPCs who are not physically intimidating, but brutal to be grilled by or to try and deceive. One could imagine a corrupt elderly politician who the players must attempt to outwit or remove from power who is a nightmare to deal with in this way. He manipulates people, twists their words, makes them say things they didn’t mean to say. You could pick up skills that make you much harder to read and then say something that seems like an obvious lie, baiting someone into attempting to roll a check on you at which point they get a catastrophic failure, triumphantly call you out, and completely show their hand.\nSomething that may or may not be a problem, however, is the narrowness of the margins. Catastrophic Failure and Complete Success are only 6 points away from one another. Because of the distribution of the 2d6, this means that these 6 points cover a ton of probability mass (assuming no modifiers), but that’s fully a cope. The reason the thresholds are at 3 is that a lot of other thresholds are at 3, including the other social rules, and I wanted the rules to be easier to remember. What this means is that characters with high modifiers socially will tend to completely roll characters with low modifiers. Is this a bug or a feature? Hard to say. Probably depends on your table. Does this help to create the sort of story the rest of the system will tend to create? Not sure. I think so, weakly.\nThe same effect these rules are aiming for could certainly be achieved with sufficiently good role playing, preparation, writing, and outstanding improv and acting on the part of the DM, but this is very rare and very difficult. Regardless, most groups that are able to play social games that well will tend to ignore or avoid leaning too much on social rules that exist in their system. At least, as far as I can tell. I think a framework that encourages and supports this sort of play is useful and valuable, anyway. TTRPG players may need social crutches is what I’m saying. Most games are not your favorite professionally produced DnD campaign."

    "text": "Increasing Scores\nIf you want to know how much it costs to go from 0 to any number where the number is x, use this equation: (x(x+1))/2. You can also just use summation notation (Σn).\n\nSome Basic Statistics for Making Your Own Randomized Character Creation Rolls\nAt a glance it might seem like d6-3 and d4-2 should be equally good. The expected value of a d6 is 3.5, so 3.5 - 3 = 0.5. EV of a d4 is 2.5, 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 as well, so why is d6-3 twice as good as d4-2? Getting to 2 in a score costs 3 SP (1 + 2), but getting to 3 costs 6 SP (1 + 2 + 3). Crucially, raising your score from a negative number always costs 1 SP, so if you roll a 1 on d6-3, you end up with -2, which is only equivalent to getting -2 SP (that is, you only have to spend 2 more SP than if you never bothered rolling at all) but if you roll a 6, you get a score of 3 which is worth 6 SP. High rolls are a lot more rewarding than low rolls are punishing at character creation.\nIf you want to figure out your own randomization schemes (that involve a single die) and what their equivalent average SP value is, doing so is relatively simple. First, you figure out all of the possible rolls. For d6-3, these rolls are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 (a roll of 1 - 3 = -2, etc.). Then find the “values” or SP you would have to spend to get that score for the rolls. For d6-3 these are -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 6. To get the average value, just add up all the SP values and divide by the number of rolls (because all of the rolls will be equally likely). In the case of d6-3, you get 1.5. Finally, multiply the per-roll-SP-value you just found by the number of scores you’re rolling for to see the equivalent SP.\nRemember that randomization means PCs will end up with characters whose scores are “worth” different amounts of SP.\nFinally, consider giving players some points specifically to buy skills with. Or don’t!"

If multiple characters on the same side have the same AGI, they choose among themselves who goes first. If there is a tie, then the side with the most characters goes first. If that is a tie, roll an AGI contest.\n\n\nWhen things happen in your turn.\nFirst, effects that take place “at the beginning of your next turn” take place, this includes damage from poison, health from healing, spell effects, etc. Then, tokens, effects, AP, numbers, are all lowered by 1. AP that was on square 2 of the tracker goes to 1, 1 to 0. You lose 1 stack of poison, 1 stack of healing, etc. Finally, you can take your turn.\nIf you’re using the optional interrupt rules: Ending your turn means the next person in initiative goes, but if you have the AP you can always still try to use a move with [interrupt]. Remember, if your turn has passed, the interrupt attempt doesn’t cost AP, but you still have to have a contest with whoever you’re trying to interrupt if they don’t want you to interrupt them, for example, all enemies."

So, if you’re a STR based warrior who has been fighting for the last couple hours, you might get SP earmarked for that, rather than SP that can be used to improve your persuasion. If you want to improve your persuasion, work at it somehow. Persuade some folks. TTYDM. Character advancement is admittedly calvinball right now.\nAdditionally, increasing attributes is probably too cheap and skills are probably too expensive."

To quickly get this out of the way, there’s no way I’m picking OGL, fuck that trash fire. It’ll probably be some Creative Commons or Copyleft nonsense.\nI’m tired of seeing cool databases, archives, tooling, or projects limited by copyright. I’m tired of DRM, licenses, censure, “platforms”, “live service”, subscriptions, and paywalls. Why do we need this in TTRPGs? It seems to me that this medium would especially benefit from being open and collaborative, so that works can be transferred, shared, altered, transformed, etc. This should be encouraged and supported, not just “allowed”. Don’t presenting the information in a pdf only, distribute the source so people don’t have to copy, wrangle, and scrape the pdf. You have the data! If you want people to engage with it, just give them the data.\nI understand this is easier said than done. One purpose of this project is to present a proof of concept, to show that one could use the technology we have now to make creating and sharing easier instead of harder.\nI like physical TTRPG books. I buy them from creators I like despite the current state-of-the-industry, not because of it. I want to write and print a book without middlemen and publishers, I want it to be available online for anyone. I want the work I put in making this possible to help other people do the same.\nIf you want to engage with the work as a whole the way it was intended, then you will be free to buy the book. If you don’t want to buy it for some reason, whatever reason, just print it at some library, read it on your computer or phone, whatever! You already know people need money to get food to eat. Supporting things you like to the degree that you can is a solved problem, there’s nothing else to say! You already know what to do!\nIf you just want a big stack of swords for your own much cooler setting, godspeed! If you want to an encounter generator for your own setting and want to grab a couple monsters, do it. Download the files, repurpose my code, make something cool, don’t ask me before you do it! Then share it so other people can do the same.\nObviously I want to be able to point to “ah, this is my setting, it’s the one I made, this is the stuff that is canonically in it”. Of course people should be able to do that. Does copyright help here? I’m not convinced. It seems, in fact, to mostly hurt people that actually make things. Is this what a trademark is for? I don’t know. Are these questions immiserating? Yes. Is this why I started doing this stuff? No. Am I tired of writing this? Yes."
