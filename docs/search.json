    "text": "A basic player character statblock looks like this:\nHealth: (3)9\nMovement Speed: 4\nSTR: 0\nAGI: 0\nWIL: 0\nPER: 0\nSOC: 0\n\n\nCharacter health is tracked as (X)Y where X is critical or “crit” health and Y is standard health. When crit health reaches 0, the character falls unconscious and begins dying. When a character runs out of standard health all subsequent damage reduces crit health. Crit damage reduces crit health directly, it does not matter how much standard health a character still has. Crit damage is notated with parentheses.\nThis health score of (3)9 is higher than what most people have! a very old or frail person might be (1)1, a normal adult might be (2)6. The default character block with (3)9 health and 0s for all attributes represents a healthy, able person with no deficiencies.\n\n\n\n“Movement Speed” determines how many spaces a character moves when they spend 1 AP to move during initaitive.\n\n\n\nAttribute scores are not mandatory descriptions of qualities. They represent abilities or tools that the character has. They tend to range from -3 to +3. The attribute score is the same as the modifier on a check using that attribute. The “passive” score, the score that other characters roll against, is 6+SCORE. If you do not have an attribute score, it is not a narrative tool that you use to solve problems. You can have attribute scores not listed here.\nThis set of scores is listed because they are the “defensive” attributes. That means these are the only attributes that other characters are allowed to roll checks against. If you do not have an attribute score, any checks made against that attribute succeed automatically.\n\n\nStrength is used to perform actions like lifting or breaking things as well as some actions like grappling. It’s also used to resist physical conditions like poison, disease, and exhaustion.\n\n\n\nAGI is your ability to evade attacks, grab on to ledges to keep yourself from falling, avoid falling rocks, etc. It is your ability to avoid physical danger.\nIt is also your ability to do a flip, jump over a chasm, etc. This is not your DEX / Dexterity! DEX is your fine motor skills, your ability to do card tricks, pickpocket, and juggle. DEX is not a “defensive” score.\n\n\nAttacks are checks against passive AGI. The attacker wins ties. Some mechanics like armor can replace passive AGI in the context of attack checks.\n\n\n\n\nWIL is your ability to resist mental conditions like fear. It is used to resist many supernatural effects. It is also used for most supernatural abilities, like writing hexes.\n\n\n\nPER is your resistance to stealth and being tricked.\nIt is also your ability to investigate, spot things other people miss, quickly find things, etc.\n\n\n\nSOC is your resistance to being manipulated.\nSOC is also your ability to manipulate, to schmooze. It’s your gab, your social acumen. Social rules are covered in greater detail later in this document.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a character wants to do something using an attribute they roll 2d6 and add the relevant SCORE. The result of the roll is determined by comparing the roll to a Difficulty Class or DC. This is a “check”. If the character’s check is the same as the DC or higher, they succeed. Often the DC for a check is the passive SCORE of another character.\nIf two charactes are in direct competition they are in a “contest”. They both roll 2d6 and add their scores. The higher score wins. In the case of a tie, they either tie in the game or if that does not make sense they redo the contest.\n\n\nSometimes, skills or weapons will have additional effects triggered “on 6”, “on at least one 6” or “on matching”. This means that if you succeed and the dice you rolled fulfilled the requirement (being a six, both dice matching, etc.) the effect is activated.\n“on 6” effects can be triggered twice if you roll two 6s, “at least one 6” effects only trigger once. “on matching” triggers on any set of matching dice rolled.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have “advantage”, roll an extra d6 for your check and pick two. When you have “disadvantage”, roll another d6, then pick the two lowest rolls. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out and are cumulative.\nIf you somehow have disadvantage twice and advantage four times, you have advantage twice. Roll four dice and pick two.\n\n\n\nAP is used during “initiative”. Initiative is any situation where many characters want to do things at the same time and the order in which things happen is important. Initiative is most often combat, but it can include other time sensitive events like chases or races.\nEvery character has 3 AP cards.5 The cards say “1 AP” and indicate what character they belong to with a name, a symbol, or both. Most actions cost 1 AP, but you can do a “reasonable amount” of simple things like talking for free.\nSome terms:\nDeck: This is the deck of cards that the DM (or whoever) draws from during initiative. The deck that the whole table uses.\nDiscard: The discard pile for the whole table.\nHand: The cards that you have been dealt and are holding on to.\n“Spending” AP: Cards that have been used or removed that go to the discard and are shuffled back together for the next round’s deck.\n“Losing” AP: “Lost” AP is not shuffled back into the deck at the end of the round. It must be “regained” either mechanically or automatically at the end of initiative.\n“Interrupt”: Spend 1 AP, act immediately\nWhen initiative starts all characters pass their cards to the DM. This includes their AP and any other special cards. The DM shuffles these cards together to create the deck. The DM pulls a card from the top of the deck and either deals the card to the character/player that it belongs to or follows the rules on the card.\nWhen a character is dealt a card they can choose to act using whatever cards they currently have in their hand. They can also just hold on to the card. When cards are spent or activated they get placed in the discard.\nAny character can interrupt in order to act at any time, doing this costs 1 AP. The round ends when the table deck is empty and everyone who still has AP has had a chance to interrupt to act with their remaining AP.\nAt the end of a round, cards that have been discarded are shuffled together to create the deck for the next round. Cards that have been lost are not, they are set aside until they are regained, or initiative ends.\nThis initiative system is intended for combat that is fast and unpredictable.\n\n\nSome types of actions have multiple AP costs. The first time you perform the action in a round it costs the first amount, the second time you do it, it costs the second, etc. These costs are connected with arrows, like this: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3. This does not limit how many times you can perform an action. If you are at the last cost, pay that amount of AP again to do the action.\n\n\n\n“Temp AP” must be spent immediately when it is recieved or it is lost. If you spend no AP for an entire round, regain 1 AP.\n\n\n\nVery rarely, the particular order things happen in the “beginning of the round” will matter. In that case, effects resolve in this order:\n\n\nAny already active effects that trigger “at the beginning of a round” happen first. It happens before anything else in the round does. Examples includes taking damage from [poison] or [bleed] or gaining health from [heal]. If you have some effect or condition that causes you to do some sort of roll or contest, do that now.\n\n\n\nStatuses are added or removed now. A point of [poison] is removed, a point of [heal] is removed, anything that would end at the “beginning” of this round ends now.\n\n\n\nSome moves and skills can be used “at the beginning of the round”. These must be used after effects and statuses resolve.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacters gain XP by solving problems, navigating difficult situatoins, etc. XP can be used to increase attribute scores or acquire more skills. There are no character levels in Actlite.\n\n\nIncreasing a negative attribute costs 1 XP. Increasing a positive attribute costs a number of XP equal to the new attribute score. This means going from 2 STR to 3 STR costs 3 XP. Going from -1 STR to 2 STR costs 1 (-1 to 0) + 1 (0 to 1) + 2 (1 to 2) = 4 XP.\nSome species or groups have hard limits on attribute scores and/or alternative costs for upgrading some attribute scores.\n\n\n\nCharacters gain skills by rolling on “Archetype Tables”, collections of thematically or mechanically similar skills. Archetype Tables can have attribute score requirements or some other setting-specific requirement. They can also have varying XP costs for rolls, notated similarly to variable AP costs so that the first roll costs X, the second roll costs Y, and all subsequent rolls have an XP cost of Z, notated X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z. This allows some tables to reward specialization, and some to punish it. If no cost is listed, rolling costs on the table costs 1 XP.\nSkills in tables are loosely ordered by desirability. If a player gets a skill they already have by rolling on an archetype table, they get the skill below/before it in the table. If none are below it, they get the first skill above it. A player cannot roll on a table when they have every skill on the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing, stowing, switching weapons, or picking a weapon up off the ground costs 1 AP, dropping a weapon is free. Searching for something you have on your person but you do not have ready is 1 AP. If what you need is further away, like in a backpack you are wearing, pay 2 AP to take off the bag, open it, rummage through it, etc.\n\n\n\n\nStealth is an AGI check against the defender’s passive perception. It’s a check against a passive score, and that is always 6 + SCORE.\n\n\nTo start a grapple, perform a “grapple check”, which is a +STR to-hit [reach: close] attack that costs 2 AP. While grappling an opponent, you have advantage on [reach: close] attacks against them, they have disadvantage on attacks against you. You can move them by one space or you can both go to the ground at the cost of 1 AP. Defender can spend 2 AP to trigger another STR contest to try and break free. Defender can do nothing but attack and try to end the grapple. You cannot grapple a creature larger than yourself. There are grappling skills that add a lot of other options.\n\n\n\nFall damage is a d4 for every 6 spaces up to 25d4.",

Some skills may require weapons with particular tags, like “range: close” or “hilt”. Weapon tags describe how the weapon is handled. There are six main weapon tags, “hilt”, “pole”, “one-handed” (or “1-h”), “two-handed” (“2-h”), reach and range.\nhilt: A weapon with a hilt. A “hilt” is a “well-defined” handle or grip which often2 includes some kind of guard to protect the users hand. Swords, knives, and daggers, are hilt weapons, as are patas and katars.\npole: Pole weapons. Weapons with a long shaft rather than a well defined grip. Pole weapons include spears, axes, hammers, and of course, all polearms.\none-handed: A weapon designed to be used with one hand. If you use two hands on a one-handed weapon, treat your STR as 2 points higher for the purposes of meeting a STR requirement.\ntwo-handed: If you try to wield a two-handed weapon with one hand, attack with disadvantage.\nreach: How many spaces does your weapon reach? If this tag is absent, assume the weapon has reach: 1. If a weapon has [reach: close], you are treated as if you move briefly into the opponents space to attack them. This is often relevant for particular skills.\nrange: Used for ranged weapons. \nTags can be combined to accommodate unusual weapons like “hand-and-a-half” a.k.a. “bastard” swords or this thing.",

They are: B for “Bludgeoning”, P for “Piercing”, and S for “Slashing”.\nThere are also sub-types like Severing, Slicing, and Picking. Severing damage counts as S, but S does not count as Severing. The damage sub-type will share the first letter of the generic damage type. This has worked so far because there are a lot of conveniently placed words in English.\nThe most common sub-types of damage are:\nSlicing: What a saber does. A long fast drawing cut, often with a curved blade.\nSevering: What an axe does. A chopping motion.\nPicking: What a warpick does. A swinging motion.\nBashing: Reserved for heavy, crushing blows.\n\n\nEffects and Conditions\nWeapons often have extra effects that trigger “on 6”, “on matching”. Rolling a 6 and a 4 will give you a total of 10 (+ any bonuses) and if you succeed, the 6 might activate some additional effect. This makes gaining advantage even more useful, as it increases your chance of activating effects.\nOften, weapons use common effects and inflict common statuses or conditions. These conditions and effects are listed below. Conditions are notated in brackets, effects are in quotes. Common weapon conditions and effects are listed below.\n\nEffects\n“Bypass”: Ignore an amount of damage reduction from armor equal to your To-Hit bonus.\n“Pull”: The target can be moved one space in any direction except backwards. Target can spend 1 AP to trigger a STR contest. If they win, they are not moved.\n“Push”: The target is pushed back one space. Target can spend 1 AP to trigger a STR contest. If they win, they are not pushed back.\n“Rend”: If armor reduced the damage of this attack note whether the damage type was B, P, or S. Reduce the armor’s damage reduction against that damage type by the To-Hit bonus of this attack.\nCommon status effects are listed in their own section.\n\n\nCombat Maneuvers\nThese effects are inflicted in addition to damage on a successful attack, they allow you to build a strategy around a certain fighting style or weapon type. These effects and conditions are not meant to encapsulate everything you can do! For everything else:\nOn a successful attack, describe the maneuver you are attempting to perform. The target can either let you do it or take the damage of the attack as usual. Credit.\nUse this to disarm, knock people out, etc. You can also use this to do what would normally be done by “Push” or some other effect, you just won’t get damage on top of the maneuver.",

Sometimes this means feverish study, sometimes this means clear-headed meditation.\n\nMechanics\nYou can try to learn individual hexes by studying the hexes themselves or you can roll on a hex archetype table. This magic system does not hand players a great big catalog of spells to choose from. Every character should end up with a unique set of hexes that they have to learn to utilize effectively. You are meant to improvise with what you get and use your hex library to write your own signature combinations.\n\nLearning Combined Hexes\nWhen you succeed in learning a hex that is composed of multiple hexes, you learn every unknown hex in the combination.

    "text": "Additional Context\nIndividual hexes might override any rule listed above. For example, many [modifier] hexes can be added to hexes you did not write.\nHexes can also impose additional restrictions, requirements, or costs. For example, taking extra time to create, having unique costs for creation or activation, or only being compatible with certain hexes.\n\n[durable] Casting and Hex Tables\n[durable] hexes can be written into a “hex pallete”. Hexes can be built from combinations of hexes in the same table and immediately cast without the caster having to write the hex down. Diegetically, a hex “table” might be called a pallete, a matrix, or something else depending on the tradition or school.\n[durable] hexes often come with additional or alternative casting requirements. Some hexes can only be cast as [durable] hexes. [independent] Hexes\nTo make a hex [independent], a scrivener must attach a [modifier] that consists of two parts.\nThe first is the “key”. The “key” is the first step in breaking the unique connection between scrivener and hex. It varies from person to person and from hex to hex. The writer must figure out the unique key for each hex they cast, they cannot use someone else’s.\nThe second part is a “hex signature”. This is a unique hex that you will use every time you make a hex [independent]. The signature does not, on its own, identify you. if someone sees your signature they won’t necessarily know it is yours. However once they do know, they will recognize the signature in every [independent] hex you write. You cannot change your signature.\nTwo people writing the same non-[independent] hex will write nearly identical hexes. Once they make their hexes [independent] they have to leave distinct signatures. Unless steps are taken to obfuscate the contents of the entire hex, the signature is obvious. The process of making a hex [independent] often means adding a large number of alterations that make it hard for other scriveners to learn the hex, but reading it remains relatively easy.\nSome hexes can be made [independent] relatively easily. For some hexes the process is very difficult or costly. Many hexes (especially powerful hexes) cannot be made independent through any known means. If a hex is not [independent], it is bound to an author and follows the usual casting rules\n\n\nInvocations\nInvocations are [independent] hexes written on long and narrow strips of material. Most often this is paper. Invocations are by far the most common type hex. Many people never come into contact with hexes, most that do only come in contact with invocations. Invocations typically have relatively minor effects. Invocations are almost always activated by tearing the medium they are written on.\nInvocations are almost always [independent] so that they do not lose potency. Additionally, [modifier] hexes that harm the author are very easy to write, so any sane scrivener wouldn’t part with a hex without making it [independent] first.\nSome of the reasons for the format of the invocation is practical. A long slip of paper is easy to fully rip in half, guaranteeing activation. They are easy to tear with one hand. This is especially useful for weapon invocations, where the invocation is wrapped around either the handle or the hand wielding the weapon. Prayers are written in a similar format.",

    "text": "The Isopods are an ancient people with courts, politics, philosophy, and dynasties. In addition to being able to write and speak, they can bypass language entirely, communicating complex thoughts and feelings directly to one another via pheromones. They do this instinctively, like a person moving their face.\nThe Isopod word for what we would call thought is approximately “inner thought” where pheromones are “outer thought”. Their word for themselves is approximately “thinker”.\nIn the ornate and ancient Isopod courts, richly painted Isopods attempt to subtly manipulate each other by precisely deploying pheromones, they use bottled pheromones to mislead and persuade. They can strategically steer the mood of a room through highly trained covert manipulators (though an Isopod gentleman would never admit to this).\nIsopods view life in the caves as beautiful, ancient, and harmonious. In the caves their pheromones are not tossed around by the wind. It is natural and just that the underground should be so vast and varied while the surface is just the end of useful space. They believe the world must be a sphere, as a sphere would maximize underground volume while minimizing surface area. They find it tremendously convenient that when a form of life is meant to be eaten they generally have their hard structure on the inside. Clearly, this could only serve the purpose of making them more suitable as food. They see their ability to speak to lower life as a great convenience, like being able to order around your coat rack. They are not religious, so a question their philosophers must grapple with is “Why, if there is no God, is the world so just?”\nIsopods also have philosophies on the nature of being and consciousness. They believe that their ability to directly communicate their thoughts and emotions means they can verify and understand the experience and the consciousnesses of other Isopods. Groups that do not have this ability cannot meaningfully be called concious. Most Isopods think of other groups as complex automata, not capable of any true thought or socialization, like plants. They are not generally hostile or even rude to other forms of life. To mistreat a lower life form would not be immoral per se, but it would be tremendously gauche. If you tell an Isopod your name, say “Tod” and it has reason to remember your name, it will refer to you as “itsa Tod”. If it is being very respectful, “It Calls Itself Tod”.\nIsopods once ruled the earth and they believe their time will come again. They are one of the oldest forms of life, persisting largely unchanged through time. They have mixed views on other bugs, depending on their ability to communicate.\nThey absolutely revile the ants and want them exterminated. They read what primitive “pheromones” the ants create as a sort of repugnant malignancy below the level of thought.

    "text": "The Isopods are an ancient people with courts, politics, philosophy, and dynasties. In addition to being able to write and speak, they can bypass language entirely, communicating complex thoughts and feelings directly to one another via pheromones. They do this instinctively, like a person moving their face.\nThe Isopod word for what we would call thought is approximately “inner thought” where pheromones are “outer thought”. Their word for themselves is approximately “thinker”.\nIn the ornate and ancient Isopod courts, richly painted Isopods attempt to subtly manipulate each other by precisely deploying pheromones, they use bottled pheromones to mislead and persuade. They can strategically steer the mood of a room through highly trained covert manipulators (though an Isopod gentleman would never admit to this).\nIsopods view life in the caves as beautiful, ancient, and harmonious. In the caves their pheromones are not tossed around by the wind. It is natural and just that the underground should be so vast and varied while the surface is just the end of useful space. They believe the world must be a sphere, as a sphere would maximize underground volume while minimizing surface area. They find it tremendously convenient that when a form of life is meant to be eaten they generally have their hard structure on the inside. Clearly, this could only serve the purpose of making them more suitable as food. They see their ability to speak to lower life as a great convenience, like being able to order around your coat rack. They are not religious, so a question their philosophers must grapple with is “Why, if there is no God, is the world so just?”\nIsopods also have philosophies on the nature of being and consciousness. They believe that their ability to directly communicate their thoughts and emotions means they can verify and understand the experience and the consciousnesses of other Isopods. Groups that do not have this ability cannot meaningfully be called concious. Most Isopods think of other groups as complex automata, not capable of any true thought or socialization, like plants. They are not generally hostile or even rude to other forms of life. To mistreat a lower life form would not be immoral per se, but it would be tremendously gauche. If you tell an Isopod your name, say “Tod” and it has reason to remember your name, it will refer to you as “itsa Tod”. If it is being very respectful, “It Calls Itself Tod”.\nIsopods once ruled the earth and they believe their time will come again. They are one of the oldest forms of life, persisting largely unchanged through time. They have mixed views on other bugs, depending on their ability to communicate.\nThey absolutely revile the ants and want them exterminated. They read what primitive “pheromones” the ants create as a sort of repugnant malignancy below the level of thought. Their hate and fear is magnified by the growing number of ants.\nIsopods converse in great halls built into their cave networks.

    "text": "Isopod Anatomy, Movement\nIsopods have thick layered bands of chitin along their top side. This forms their natural armor. They have seven pairs of jointed appendages. Each appendage ends in two articulated long sticky fingers. The two front pairs of appendages are the longest, with long fingers meant for fine manipulation. Lacking thumbs, the Isopods use their arms in vertical pairs with the two suspended top fingers and two suspended bottom fingers working in tandem, each finger opposable. The appendages after the foremost pairs become shorter and their main purpose shifts from manipulation to movement. They move low, using all of the limbs that line their body. They move parallel to the ground, with the bulk of their limbs folded under them. Isopods are larger than humans, though of course they are shorter when walking. They do not call their movement “crawling”.\nThey will tip their front portions upward in a couple of situations. The first is when engaged in some especially demanding manual task where lifting something in front of themselves using only a couple of limb pairs is not enough, as when playing musical instruments or when weaving. The second is when in a posture of deference or trust."

Because of this low fighting position and the arrangement of their limbs they rarely employ weapons that require large swinging motions, preferring to rely largely on long thrusting weapons. There are no Isopodan greataxes.\n\nMelee\nIn close quarters they employ katars, patas, and insectoid claw weapons. They also wield long shields held parallel to the ground. Sometimes these are lined with spikes.\n\nPolearms\nThey often wield spears, grasping them with many arm-pairs at a time, coordinating arm pairs to thrust the weapon forward. They also wield a unique variety of polearm, called a “fork” by outsiders (the proper name can only be expressed via pheromone). Forks are long asymmetric polearms with sharp spear points at the end. The heads of the polearm are always flat on one side so that they be easily wielded near the ground. The opposite side can have a wide variety of features, the most common being a long and gently curved wavy blade sticking out at a right angle, sharp on both sides. This can be used defensively to keep an opponent at bay but it can also be used to hook a limb, at which point the Isopod uses their many arm pairs in tandem to wrench the blade back. If the Isopod has a spiked shield or katar they can pull the opponent closer with the blade while attacking with their sidearm, trapping them between the weapons.\nThe forks excel when used to fight other bugs. They can be used to attack the rows of delicate limbs. They can be slipped under another shelled creature, turned so that the blade faces upward, and then torn across the soft underbelly of the opponent, bypassing their armor entirely.\nTheir polearms are made of an extremely sharp and light organic material. The finest, sharpest, and lightest of their polearms are marbled by many colors. The secretive Isopodan craftsmen have accrued thousands of years experience and knowledge crafting these deadly polearms. Because of the effectiveness of the weapons against the Isopods themselves, they do not trade them with other groups and they keep careful track of them. A non-isopod simply being in posession of a marbled isopodan fork is seen as an act of open hostility.\n\n\n\nRanged\nThey use their long powerful fore-limbs to throw out rope darts or barbed blades, then they either retract the projectiles or attach the ropes to the surfaces of the cave, suspending the opponent from multiple points. They also use crossbows that they can quickly wind with their limb-pairs if they flip over. They cannot wield normal bows and slings effectively."

Many of these documents have outlived their original purpse, but through addendums, conditions, and stipulations, they persist as perversions of their original forms. It isn’t known who started the network or whether its creation was intentional. The network may have been an attempt to create laws that could themselves govern, interpret, and enforce.\nThe Bureau’s strength lies in their arcane use of information and agreements, not brute force.

    "text": "The Forerunner / Receptionist\n\nDescription\nA black cylinder is driven through a thick stack of written records and into the head of the slumped creature. Only the thing’s gumless wheezing mouth is visible. The pages covering its face are of all sizes. They are small cards, letters, entire scrolls, they are made of ancient papyrus and fine white cardstock, they are clay tablets, leaves, scalps, hides. Covering these records are handprints, wild script, dead languages, moving glyphs, bright red blood, every form of marking. Curdled black fluid oozes lazily from around the stack and down the front of the its atrophied body. It is fat and weak. It smells like mildew. It sits hunched over a thin table. It wears a collared shirt.\n\n\nFirst Encounter\nIt’s friendly. It asks questions about superficial qualities, name, eye color, height, etc. Then it starts asking innocuous questions about both the subject’s current state and some recent events the subject has experienced. It knows things it should not know. It requires answers from the subject, it requires that information is confirmed. As the conversation progresses it asks increasingly meaningless semantic questions. The questions become more invasive. It to asks its questions while darkly hinting at terrible consequences should the wrong answer be given. It asks the subject to pick from a set of nearly identical options. It is patient. It is meticulous.\nAs answers are given, it will tear out a stake from its pale flesh. The stake might be a pen or it might just be used as one. It patiently records what is said. It asks the same questions over and over in slightly different forms, explaining how the questions are different when challenged.\nIt will insist that the subject is lucky to have run across the Bureau when they did, otherwise their debts and obligations may have grown to catastrophic proportions, now at least the subject can take control.\nAs the stake runs out of ink the Bureaucrat will drive it back into the wound to refill it. As the interaction progresses it will insist that the subject take certain forms and pens, filling out the forms, recording and reporting their actions, submitting the forms. It will insist that, to better make sure the forms are tracked and kept safe, the subject simply must allow the bureaucrat to attach the form directly to the subject with a small pin. This is, of course, just a small note to be attached with a small pin, it’s a convenient magic that allows the subject to never misplace the form.\nThe more information a subject gives and the more a subject engages, the more power the Bureau has over the subject. The Receptionist might first appear when the character is weak or in need, offering a service, information, or healing. It never specifies what it wants in return, if asked it will give a long explanation about how the service is not only free but it also entitles you to unspecified future services, advantages, and “opportunities”. If pressed it might admit that yes there could be some minor service fees but these are merely a formality, they can be waived or some arrangement could be found.\nThe Receptionist is after two things, information and some reason to be involved. It wants the subject to be visible, registered, quantified. It wants a confirmation of some instance in which the subject was wronged or perhaps wronged another. It wants the subject to accept some aid from the Bureau or accept some deal with the Bureau. The Receptionist is almost always the first member of the Bureau that any given character meets.\n\n\nMisc.\nWhen faced with a Receptionist the best move is to say nothing and kill it where it sits. This will make an enemy of the faction unless it is done from stealth or otherwise untraceable.\nThe Bureau cannot see art. It is literally invisible to them, its effects unknowable. Because of this it is not uncommon for illiterate travelers to carry books of poetry in order to beat to death Bureaucrats that appear in front of them.\nThe body of a Bureaucrat is good as a source of cheap ink and kindling."

    "text": "What kind of game is this?\nThe base rules should be flexible enough that they can be modified to run many types of games in many types of settings. That being said, the setting, weapons, etc. presented in this site are focused on creating a game where the player characters are not inherently special. This game is about normal people making their way through a dangerous and fantastic world.\n\n\nTone and Goals\nThe world of this game is much bigger than the players and it moves without any concern for them. When players meet a creature there should be no expectation that they will be able to kill it. If players pick a fight they can’t win, that’s on them. Characters might lose limbs. They might die as a part of normal combat. The game is not built to make players straightforwardly more powerful over time, but that doesn’t mean they have no agency. Players have resources to advance their characters. If a player wants more health, they can choose to spend their limited resources on health. The same is true for skills. Characters should grow in response to the pressures they face. Characters become better at what they try to do, they do not progress smoothly along a given plan. There are no classes and there are no levels. There is no destination. There are only small people and their unreasonable efforts and goals.\nThere are skills for fantastic magic powers as well as more mundane abilities like quickly drawing a weapon, disarming an opponent, parrying a blow, and effective use of a shield. Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, different weapons have different AP costs, different reach. Some might be better at slashing than piercing. A player should think carefully about what they take with them and what they can do with it. The reason for the great historical variety of weapons is that different designs work better in different contexts and for different purposes. I’d like a game that lets you engage with that dynamic and expands on it with interesting and relatively light mechanics.\nIn general, the context a character finds themselves in at any point is hugely important. Say you have a very advanced knight-type character with all sorts of skills. He’s in heavy armor standing guard at a gate. There’s a relatively weak assassin character who has specialized in stealth and sneak attacks. The assassin has a long thin dagger meant for slipping through armor. The assassin manages to catch the knight unaware, prepares his strike, and drives the dagger through his neck. The knight is almost certainly dead. In a direct fight the assassin would have no chance at all. This, basically, is how balance is handled (or not handled). The quality of skills, weapons, and character types depend on context and creativity. If you’re that knight standing guard, you probably want to invest in your perception, you probably want someone watching your back. In general, you should be thinking about what other people might try, you should be thinking about your vulnerabilities and how you’re going to deal with them.\nCombat is not orderly. You should be trying to take every advantage you can find. You should be trying to break the game. The flexibility of the system should give you the freedom to engage with combat in whatever way seems fun or interesting to you. Yan could set up status effects and conditions to required for very powerful moves. You can dodge and weave around attacks, finding an opening for a critical strike. You can use illusion and deception. You can make a big unga-bunga man who wields a club made from a whole tree. Maybe this was a weapon that was never meant to be wielded by a player character, a weapon from some huge troll. As long as you have the right set of attributes, you can use it. You could also just talk your way out of a fight or sneak around and avoid the interaction entirely. Set up distractions, traps, bribe someone so you find out your enemies weaknesses beforehand. The way that you deal with situations should be unique to your character and your skillset.\nAn old wizard beset by bandits doesn’t have 10 times as much Health as they do because he’s “a high level wizard”. He might have less health than they do. However, he has the tools and knowledge to make such an encounter trivial anyway.\nThere are games that are built to make you feel a lot more powerful than everyone else in the game world, games that are far better suited to playing out the story of a legendary adventurer who went from hunting rats to slaying dragons. This is not that game. This is a game about people exploring dangerous places, taking risks, and beating genuinely bad odds with quick thinking, preparation, and luck.\nOn top of all this, the game should be relatively rules-light. When rules show up they should add to the tactility of the world not take it away. They should give you more options, they should be easy to improvise and easy to improvise with. There should be no superfluous rules for “realism”. While there is a baseline of universal rules and mechanics, a player should largely get to choose what specific mechanics they use to interact with the world, whether that’s risk-reward mechanics, complex chained effects, AP cleverness, Big Numbers, thinking of the perfect illusion at the perfect time, or social charm. Players aren’t restricted to one class or the options in that class, they can combine skills and mechanics in any way they can manage.\nThese are a lot of goals in this doc. The currently existing game is an attempt at reaching toward those goals. Many of these goals are in a great deal of tension with one another."

Additionally there are only a few types of crust punks, and they’re not very important, but they still end up in this section… Maybe that’s fine?\nThey are SALT encrusted and delusional. They know the Art of Continuous Secretion. Their skin is covered in layers of hard grey crystal salt. Their body constantly produces SALT, so they have to constantly burn SALT to stay alive. Having a lot of SALT makes them near superhuman, having little cripples them. They must always stay awake as SALT buildup would kill them in their sleep. The solution to their exhaustion and the mental toll of their sleeplessness is burning more SALT. This abuse of SALT wears them down mentally and physically, a side effect that can only be addressed with even more SALT. Their dependence on SALT tends to outpace their production, and they live in a frantic search for more.\nTheir fingers are sharp clumsy daggers of salt. Their limited hand mobility makes them bad at using most weapons. When they fight, salt armor covers and envelopes their body. They fight “unarmed”, with enormous spiked fists made of salt. Most of them fight like terrifying incoherently screaming superhuman brawlers in grinding mineral plate armor. A few crust punks instead burn their SALT by moving very quickly, cutting with enormous katars fused to their closed fist during combat. Crust punks do not wear armor, it would just constrain their natural salt armor.\nSome crust punks are miners who rejected a life of toil, preferring a short brutal life of glorious combat. It’s common for powerful or sloppy crust punks to die crystallized by their own continuous SALT production, leaving behind a sparkling statue.\n\nGameplay Note\nPlayers might be able to learn unarmed techniques (including with brass knuckles, push-daggers) and improved physical augmentation through salt from them, but more likely they’re going to get jumped by a bunch of crust punks who beat them and take their SALT."

Get 1 Temp AP.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 PER\nCost: 8 SP\nFirst, specify a question. Next, the GM flips a coin in secret. Finally, the GM tells you what insane theory your character concocted by combining the information available to them with a liberal dose of moon logic. Your character wholeheartedly believes this theory.\nIf the GM got a heads on the coin flip, you get a theory that is on the right track, maybe even totally correct (at least, in it’s conclusions). If the GM got tails, you receive a theory that is as astoundingly incorrect as it is completely unhelpful. You can only use this skill on a question once. Once you use Wild Conjecture, you have to rest before you can use it again.\nYou have what could be charitably described as an “unorthodox” relationship with reason. The impressive leaps of logic you are able to perform allow you to reach conclusions that lesser thinkers would never even begin to consider. Even more impressively, sometimes you’re correct!\nBefore you take this skill, establish with the GM how you want to receive the theory. The GM could, in secret, gives you a series of “beats” to hit or facts to include along with a conclusion. Then, you roleplay and improvise the connecting tissue of the theory. Alternatively, the GM just tells you the theory. You could do something else entirely. The GM could just drop an earth shattering revelation that has a 50% chance of being false. If you’re the GM and a player uses Wild Conjecture on a question they have insufficient information to even begin answering and they get heads, get creative. Give them some little tidbit related to the answer, push them down the right track, confuse them.\nOf course your theory has a 50% chance of being right, it’s either right or it’s wrong! That’s basic statistics!\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 PER\nCost: 4 SP\n+2 when using your PER to watch for specific and brief events. You can use this to watch for a positive or negative reaction when you give another character new information, or you can watch to see if another character will try to draw a weapon, allowing you to draw yours first. Keen allows you not only to react quickly, but to anticipate actions and act first. Add +2 to your passive resistance to stealth and pickpocketing.\nYou are able to focus your perception to a razors edge, catching the briefest movement. You’re like a poker player spotting the telltale dilation of pupils as a card is dealt, or a watchman high on a tower watching for movement below. When you know what you are looking for, it’s almost as if time slows down for you for just a moment.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 0 PER\nCost: 11 SP\nFlip a coin. On a heads, all of the puzzle pieces you have snap into place, you know where to look, you know what you’re missing, you see the path to the answer. On a tails you get cryptic hints, symbols, hunches, impressions. If you get a heads but you don’t have enough information, you get particularly useful hints, symbols, hunches, impressions.\nYou cannot use Rumination during initiative. You cannot use Rumination on the same question twice. You cannot do anything complex or time sensitive while using Rumination. Once you use Rumination, you have to rest before you can use it again. You can use Rumination any time you can take a moment just to think.\nYou deeply ponder a question. You turn what you have seen and heard over in your mind, without judgement or bias. You dredge up minute details from your memory that may have, at the time, slipped past your conscious awareness. You approach your problem from all angles, crafting and discarding theories. You are fishing for an epiphany, a sudden flash of realization.\nFor GMs: This can be a difficult skill to work with! When a character uses this skill, they only get information that they have already seen or information that they “could” have seen. Give out new information sparingly with this ability! New pieces of information should be very small. Maybe a look from another character that didn’t seem like anything at the time, but is strange or out of place in hindsight. If a player has so much information the answer is staring them in the face and they get heads, at least try to give them the information slowly so they have a chance to figure it out, maybe text it to them separately so they can present their eureka moment to the rest of the party themselves.\nThis ability allows GMs to arrange the information in front of players usefully, discard some things, and focus on others. This ability is more straightforwardly useful on heads, but more interesting on tails. Tails gives the player another puzzle piece, an impression, a symbol, a hunch they can’t make sense of but can’t quite shake.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 PER\nCost: 5 SP\nYou can read the lips of characters whose faces you can see clearly.",

Before you roll your attack you can choose to add your STR to the damage or to your attack roll. If you are entering a STR contest of some kind, add your STR to your roll.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 WIL\nCost: 8 SP\nWhen you would take a point of [exhaustion], flip a coin. On heads, don’t.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 WIL\nCost: 5 SP\nDon’t suffer the penalties of [exhaustion] incurred during initiative until initiative ends. You can’t take more stacks of [exhaustion] this way than what it would take to cause you to fall [unconscious].\n\n\n\nRequirements: 0 WIL\nCost: 5 SP\nTake 1 [exhaustion]. Get advantage on your next check.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 0 WIL\nCost: 5 SP\nTake 1 [exhaustion]. Reroll any damage, check, or contest die.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 0 WIL\nCost: 5 SP\nTake 1 [exhaustion]. Get 1 Temp AP.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 PER\nCost: 8 SP\nFirst, specify a question. Next, the GM flips a coin in secret. Finally, the GM tells you what insane theory your character concocted by combining the information available to them with a liberal dose of moon logic. Your character wholeheartedly believes this theory.\nIf the GM got a heads on the coin flip, you get a theory that is on the right track, maybe even totally correct (at least, in it’s conclusions). If the GM got tails, you receive a theory that is as astoundingly incorrect as it is completely unhelpful. You can only use this skill on a question once. Once you use Wild Conjecture, you have to rest before you can use it again.\nYou have what could be charitably described as an “unorthodox” relationship with reason. The impressive leaps of logic you are able to perform allow you to reach conclusions that lesser thinkers would never even begin to consider. Even more impressively, sometimes you’re correct!\nBefore you take this skill, establish with the GM how you want to receive the theory. The GM could, in secret, gives you a series of “beats” to hit or facts to include along with a conclusion. Then, you roleplay and improvise the connecting tissue of the theory. Alternatively, the GM just tells you the theory. You could do something else entirely. The GM could just drop an earth shattering revelation that has a 50% chance of being false. If you’re the GM and a player uses Wild Conjecture on a question they have insufficient information to even begin answering and they get heads, get creative. Give them some little tidbit related to the answer, push them down the right track, confuse them.\nOf course your theory has a 50% chance of being right, it’s either right or it’s wrong! That’s basic statistics!\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 PER\nCost: 4 SP\n+2 when using your PER to watch for specific and brief events. You can use this to watch for a positive or negative reaction when you give another character new information, or you can watch to see if another character will try to draw a weapon, allowing you to draw yours first. Keen allows you not only to react quickly, but to anticipate actions and act first. Add +2 to your passive resistance to stealth and pickpocketing.\nYou are able to focus your perception to a razors edge, catching the briefest movement. You’re like a poker player spotting the telltale dilation of pupils as a card is dealt, or a watchman high on a tower watching for movement below. When you know what you are looking for, it’s almost as if time slows down for you for just a moment.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 0 PER\nCost: 11 SP\nFlip a coin. On a heads, all of the puzzle pieces you have snap into place, you know where to look, you know what you’re missing, you see the path to the answer. On a tails you get cryptic hints, symbols, hunches, impressions. If you get a heads but you don’t have enough information, you get particularly useful hints, symbols, hunches, impressions.\nYou cannot use Rumination during initiative. You cannot use Rumination on the same question twice. You cannot do anything complex or time sensitive while using Rumination. Once you use Rumination, you have to rest before you can use it again. You can use Rumination any time you can take a moment just to think.\nYou deeply ponder a question. You turn what you have seen and heard over in your mind, without judgement or bias. You dredge up minute details from your memory that may have, at the time, slipped past your conscious awareness. You approach your problem from all angles, crafting and discarding theories. You are fishing for an epiphany, a sudden flash of realization.\nFor GMs: This can be a difficult skill to work with! When a character uses this skill, they only get information that they have already seen or information that they “could” have seen. Give out new information sparingly with this ability! New pieces of information should be very small. Maybe a look from another character that didn’t seem like anything at the time, but is strange or out of place in hindsight. If a player has so much information the answer is staring them in the face and they get heads, at least try to give them the information slowly so they have a chance to figure it out, maybe text it to them separately so they can present their eureka moment to the rest of the party themselves.\nThis ability allows GMs to arrange the information in front of players usefully, discard some things, and focus on others. This ability is more straightforwardly useful on heads, but more interesting on tails. Tails gives the player another puzzle piece, an impression, a symbol, a hunch they can’t make sense of but can’t quite shake.\n\n\n\nRequirements: 1 PER\nCost: 5 SP\nYou can read the lips of characters whose faces you can see clearly.",

G maps to K and D to T, as those distinctions are not found in written Loric. C represents the extremely rare optional explicit “null vowel” letter. ’ is the character you have to put after a consonant to indicate its vowel was implicit, and if followed by another of the same letter, should not be interpreted as geminate. _ is reserved for internal use, and is forbidden to occur in your input texts. In cursive mode, if you type an invalid sequence of vowels and consonants, this will result in an invalid input indicator. Compositional straightive, and decompositional cursive, (two later & eccentric innovations of Loric printing presses) remain unimplemented here. Stacked dashes are unimplemented, but the rest of the punctuation is implemented—with fairly arbitrary ascii characters for many of them. Not all of the conventions of this project would seem idiomatic to a Loric speaker.
