### oct 3

Potentially: A user should be able to just type in a comma separated list of generic filtering params, ignore what fields these belong to. just be able to type in "weapon, hilted, basic, range: close" mixing meta-tags, matching to names... it should act as a sort of sql LIKE that ignore special characters. Generally, consider more sql LIKE stuff, maybe thats what the textinput fields should default to?

Add an ALL option, to just get a collection of ALL

being able to exlclude tags would be nice... should consider just making available a sort of query cookbook, because making UIs for this all would be annoying, unless the UI generation funcs got a lot better i guess! similar to scripts.ipynb

create some random encounter etc. generators using the "table:" system in json

bring back the dice utils!

### oct 3

Add a bigtable meta-tag that marks when a table is too large for normal cards.

### oct 5

dont allow latex to do th-  
is sort of thing.

Create a veteran skill that lets you slowly gain advantages against particular enemies and/or humanoids generally.

Encumbrance should be on the top of the card, ideally with those circle icons so they can be stacked together

The "Stuff" pages are broken. generally, site needs to be written

Check on grappling rules! should take like 2 AP at least

add an active meta-tag for:  deprecated

check on full_text, make sure it works like it should

make the weeping greatclub, red peeler? what do you call it, hunting net

create some reference material for how hard to kill, like the actlite sheet

make poisoned blowgun

meta-tag invocation should do something, and target only matters for invocatoins

\d[stealth] should probably not be a tag and we should rely on range: close

maybe entities should be underlined

maybe a spear skill that lets you use defensive perimeter instantly spending from the deck, and also breaks charges better.. at least half crit??

need to make all those isopod items...

need to make a hunting knife

MOVE ALL THIS STUFF INTO REMINDERS APP WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
