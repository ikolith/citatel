## Gnostic Typology

Different gnostic abilities and effects manifest differently. It is helpful to sort gnostic phenomenah along two axes, "persistence" and "use restricitons". "Persistence" refers to the degree to which the knowledge can be preserved, "use restriction" refers to what is required to use the knowledge.

### Persistence
In increasing order of persistence as well as cost and difficulty: 

#### Ephemeral
Single use. Sometimes context-specific. Understood for a single moment, then lost.

#### Durable 
Fixed multi-use or breaking on some condition (likely random, semi-random, or at least hard to avoid: a failed roll, doubles on the d6s, rolling a 1 on a die, etc.)

#### Persistent
Continuing to function as representation until broken or destroyed. Sacred artifacts, monuments, great works, for example. Rare, valuable, difficult to create.

### Use Restrictions
In decreasing order of restriction and increasing order of cost and difficulty:

#### Personalization and Capacity Restrained
Requires activation by a specific individual with enough GNOSIS at time of activation.

#### Personalization Restrained
Requires activation by a specific individual.

#### Cognition and Capacity Restrained
Requiring any user with sufficient GNOSIS and the abillity to engage with abstract concepts.

#### Cognition Restrained
Requiring any being capable of engaging with abstract concepts as medium. Capacity is granted at time of activationd

#### Conditionally Restrained
Requiring some condition to activate. Forbidden knowledge that has been granted the ability to "conceptualize" itself.

#### Continuously Active
Knowledge able to conceptualize itself and continuously doing so.

### Common Examples

#### Ephemeral + Personalization and Capacity Restrained: 
Most casting performed by a character with GNOSIS, the easiest and cheapest method of casting. The caster writes down the spell and only the caster can use it, provided they have the capacity.

#### Ephemeral + Cognition Restrained
Most invocations. Can be used by anyone, but only once.

#### Persistent + Cognition and Capacity Restrained
Gnostic focuses that require a minimum gnostic capacity from the wielder.

#### Persistent + Cognition Restrained
An artifact that can be used by anyone.
 
#### Persistent + Continuously Active
Reflecting basins.
