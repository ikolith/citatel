A problem that quickly came up is that of generating just a little bit of content, maybe as roll-expand but *not* recursive, not expanding the tree past some depth. This is because, presumably, while one could continuously generate a cave-tree, one would just want to generate enough to let the players go down one side, then generate from there, etc.

good to adapt existing table and generation systems to test stuff... probably have to talk to folks, because copyright, etc.

need ways to "step through" generation well

reusing danger-ranked tables... size-ranked cave generation tables..
need to be able to present "forks in the road"
