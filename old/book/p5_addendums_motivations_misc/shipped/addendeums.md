# Sixtem

## Setting Agnosticism and Attribute Edge Cases

The Sixtem rules are setting agnostic. You should be able to play only with material from one setting, or pick and choose mechanics from many settings, or move characters between settings. The rules are written so that the game is easy to extend, modify, and improvise with.

Say you have created a character in a fantasy setting with the standard scores used throughout this doc (STR, AGI, DEX etc.). This character somehow ends up in a sci-fi setting where TECH is a standard score, they went through a portal or something. It would be unreasonable to treat that character's TECH score as 0 given that they've never even seen a computer. They should treat TECH as a [special] score or have a very negative score in TECH, say -5 (expressing that it would take them a good deal of work to get to the point where they can even begin to interact with technology). There is no rule that expresses this. It is expected that if you mix settings and mechanics in this way you will have some edge cases to iron out and you will have to make up some rules on the fly. The rules are (hopefully) written to be flexible, consistent, and simple in a way that makes doing this easy.

## Character Creation

### Increasing Scores

If you want to know how much it costs to go from 0 to any number where the number is x, use this equation: (x(x+1))/2. You can also just use summation notation (Σn).

### Some Basic Statistics for Making Your Own Randomized Character Creation Rolls

At a glance it might seem like d6-3 and d4-2 should be equally good. The expected value of a d6 is 3.5, so 3.5 - 3 = 0.5. EV of a d4 is 2.5, 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 as well, so why is d6-3 twice as good as d4-2?

Getting to 2 in a score costs 3 SP (1 + 2), but getting to 3 costs 6 SP (1 + 2 + 3). Crucially, raising your score from a negative number always costs 1 SP, so if you roll a 1 on d6-3, you end up with -2, which is only equivalent to getting -2 SP (that is, you only have to spend 2 more SP than if you never bothered rolling at all) but if you roll a 6, you get a score of 3 which is worth 6 SP. High rolls are a lot more rewarding than low rolls are punishing at character creation.

If you want to figure out your own randomization schemes (that involve a single die) and what their equivalent average SP value is, doing so is relatively simple. First, you figure out all of the possible rolls. For d6-3, these rolls are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 (a roll of 1 - 3 = -2, etc.). Then find the "values" or SP you would have to spend to get that score for the rolls. For d6-3 these are -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 6. To get the average value, just add up all the SP values and divide by the number of rolls (because all of the rolls will be equally likely). In the case of d6-3, you get 1.5. Finally, multiply the per-roll-SP-value you just found by the number of scores you're rolling for to see the equivalent SP.

Remember that randomization means PCs will end up with characters whose scores are "worth" different amounts of SP. Finally, consider giving players some points specifically to buy skills with. Or don't!

## Odder and Ender

Atl-atls can only be used with [one-handed] spears. Using an atl-atl requires 1 STR, 1 DEX and adds 3 to the spear’s thrown range and +AGI to damage.
