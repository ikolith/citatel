GNOSIS is the capacity to obtain and retain "forbidden" knowledge, knowledge past the ken of human cognition. It can be thought of as psychic ability, openness to the universal mind, the ability to grasp and maintain knowledge of pure forms, the ability to glimpse the fundamental functions/nature being. This knowledge is very "slippery", difficult to hold on to, often ephemeral, grasped in a fleeting moment of enlightenment, then slipping away.

Gnostic knowledge is extremely difficult to hold entirely in one's head, typically it must be written down or otherwise represented. Writing is the most common, consistent, and stable means of doing this, writing creates quick, convenient portable artifacts. Other means do exist.
