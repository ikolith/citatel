## Increasing Scores

If you want to know how much it costs to go from 0 to any number where the number is x, use this equation: (x(x+1))/2. You can also just use summation notation (Î£n). 

### Some Basic Statistics for Making Your Own Randomized Character Creation Rolls 

At a glance it might seem like d6-3 and d4-2 should be equally good. The expected value of a d6 is 3.5, so 3.5 - 3 = 0.5. EV of a d4 is 2.5, 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 as well, so why is d6-3 twice as good as d4-2?
Getting to 2 in a score costs 3 SP (1 + 2), but getting to 3 costs 6 SP (1 + 2 + 3). Crucially, raising your score from a negative number always costs 1 SP, so if you roll a 1 on d6-3, you end up with -2, which is only equivalent to getting -2 SP (that is, you only have to spend 2 more SP than if you never bothered rolling at all) but if you roll a 6, you get a score of 3 which is worth 6 SP. High rolls are a lot more rewarding than low rolls are punishing at character creation.

If you want to figure out your own randomization schemes (that involve a single die) and what their equivalent average SP value is, doing so is relatively simple. First, you figure out all of the possible rolls. For d6-3, these rolls are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 (a roll of 1 - 3 = -2, etc.). Then find the "values" or SP you would have to spend to get that score for the rolls. For d6-3 these are -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 6. To get the average value, just add up all the SP values and divide by the number of rolls (because all of the rolls will be equally likely). In the case of d6-3, you get 1.5. Finally, multiply the per-roll-SP-value you just found by the number of scores you're rolling for to see the equivalent SP.  

Remember that randomization means PCs will end up with characters whose scores are "worth" different amounts of SP.

Finally, consider giving players some points specifically to buy skills with. Or don't!
