## SALTy Surgeon

Quick warning: this character asks more from you than some of the other pre-gens. There are parts of the character's motivations, methods, and some mechanical details that have to be fleshed out in your game.

You're a surgeon. You are absolutely convinced that by manipulating SALT you can revolutionize medicine. You will save countless lives, your likeness will be carved into stone, your name will be known by every medical student.

However, your tests and studies require huge amounts of SALT to conduct. Others just don't *understand* this or the importance of your work. SALT is an extremely valuable substance from the End, getting it transported to you while you were at the academy was incredibly expensive. You first got a hold of SALT by securing grants the old fashioned way. Of course, this did not give you enough SALT. The academy wouldn't give you the funds you needed even though you were *so* close to an answer. Naturally, you took out loans that you could easily pay back once you finally made that breakthrough. You pawned your possessions. You lied, you went hungry, you embezzled obscene amounts of money from your department.

Unfortunately, while you're a great liar, you're a terrible accountant. Soon after the discrepancies in the books were discovered and an investigation started, men were pounding at your door in the middle of the night. Thankfully, you're a very *cautious* person. You always jam a chair against the door, you clutch your bag of SALT to your chest when you sleep, you sleep fully clothed. You downed the vial of SALT you always keep around your neck, felt the power of it surge through your body, jumped out of the window, and fled down the alley.

You knew exactly where to go next. You went to the source of the SALT. You turned east and set out for the End.

You're a wanted now and you have no way of paying your debts. You've thrown away your career. You cannot return home. At least, not until proving them all wrong. You need to show them how they forced your hand, how they held back progress. You'll show them why you did what you did and how the world will benefit.
