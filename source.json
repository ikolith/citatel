Its shapes are highly varied, the colony that comprises its body improvised out of the bodies of found, slain, caught, or purchased creatures. It can be a mindless mass of claws or a giant psychic centipede of cobbled together human limbs and faces. Its entire body is a fungal colony.\n\nTo create a Legion, roll d20s. Decide beforehand how many Legions you want and of what size. \n\nFor every d20 rolled in its creation, the Legion gains a size category. 1: small. 2: medium, 4: large, 6: giant.\n\nEvery time the d20 lands on 20, raise the Legion's intelligence.\n\n0: As a stupid rabid chimp.\n\n1: Single words, sentence fragments.\n\n2: It speaks as an intelligent hivemind, pulling information, preferences, and memories from the intelligent creatures it has consumed. It flits between personalities during conversation.\n\n3: It is hyper-intelligent, capable of inscrutable magic, a powerful being comparable to a sage, a demigod, or a great demon, depending.\n\n4: As a minor deity.\n\nFor every 10 health the legion has, roll:\n\n1d4-1 limbs\n\n1d4-1 stat points, can be put in any stat that any creature it has consumed has possessed.  \n\nWith no legs a Legion can roll at 1 space per move. Every pair of legs gives it 1 extra space of speed, up to 4 pairs.  \n\nNon-leg limbs can include stingers, arms with hands, claws, pincers, torsos reduced to short spines with jaws mounted on the ends, etc. Just grab attacks from other enemies at random.  \n\nRoll 1d4-2 for every 10 health the Legion has. The Legion has that many exposed organs randomly placed along the outside perimeter of its space. The organ can be targeted for double damage with Called Shot. If a called shot is performed doing over 8 slashing damage, the legion loses that limb, (3n3 to reattach).  \n\nLegions take double damage from fire and take a max of two damage from piercing attacks (unless performed on an organ).  \n\nWhen a Legion's HP is reduced to 0, it can no longer move or function.  \n\nRoll one fewer d20 than was used to create it. For every d20 rolled, the Legion has a day to reform. Every day it rolls a d20 to regain health. If it hits half health within the time allotted, it can reform. If its parts are scattered they might reform as smaller Legions, DM discretion. Reformed Legions retain their memories. Burned portions of the Legion are fully dead. Players may try other means to fully neutralize remains.  \n\nLegions are generally hostile. They are driven by the desire to consume enough to grow larger, more powerful, more intelligent. They have to consume many times the amount of mass another creature of their size would have to. Legions do not need sleep. They are constantly hunting and eating. They hold grudges.  \n\nGiven that they prey on everything they are universally hated. That is, of course, unless they grow large enough to become powerful allies. They are extremely difficult to eradicate. Their invisible spores hang in the air waiting to colonize the sick or recently deceased. There are whispered stories of those who, in a desperate bid to survive, seek a symbiotic relationship by cultivating Legion within themselves. There is no documented case of this working."
