A player should be able to only read Book I. If they're avoiding spoilers for what they might see in the world and only want the necessary background information about the world, they should *definitely* only read Book I!

## SECTION 0: Frontmatter

Here goes the typical frontmatter stuff, table of contents, etc.  More importantly this is where a summary of the structure of the book should be presented. Ideally that will be done as early as possible. This should express to the reader what parts they should or should not read according to their preferences re:spoilers, context, time, etc.

Frontmatter will be written after everything else, as it is mostly context and navigation. Need something to give context to!

## SECTION I: THE RULES

Hypothetically, "The Sixtem" and "Tactile" should be easily separated as a portable ruleset for vaguely fantasy/archaic settings.

"The Sixtem" -> "Tactile" -> "Talaje Specific Rules" goes from generic to specific re:rules.

### The Sixtem

This is the core of the system. It consists of things like checks, the composition of characters, skill types (standard, [special], etc), rolls, etc.

### Tactile

Context specific conflict resolution rules. Social rules, combat rules, that sort of thing.

### Talaje Specific Rules

Primarily HYLIC/PSYCHIC, SALT rules, other basic mechanics of the world. 

## SECTION II: TALAJE CHARACTER CREATION

### Quickstart, Preroll/Example Characters

The idea here is that a player *could* just pick a preroll here, but even if they don't they will see what a starter character *tends to look like,* giving them useful context for the rest of the section.

### Setting Specific Character Creation Procedure

I'm not sure, honestly, what exactly this consists of. Maybe it's just the context of what various levels of SP might be? I don't know. Maybe the context of setting specific procedure for every step will be provided in that step! Anyway, what is not provided in that way will go in this section.

### Base Character Options ("Species", Background, etc)

It's likely that for some of the species or peoples options, the reader will be directed to the relevant section in BOOK II.

### Starting Gear Shopping (including premade loadouts)

Basic weapons, equipment, ropes, backpacks, etc. Shopping. Should provide some structure/seeds for the next step.

### Character Skill/Attribute Shopping

Likely the largest most complex part of SECTION II. The part that players will most often be referring back to.
