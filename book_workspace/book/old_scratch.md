Weapons without specific requirements can be treated as having a requirement for -1 of whatever score is used to hit. 

Rounds or the time it takes for everyone to act, take about 6 seconds.

**All attacks with all weapons count as the “same” sort of move for the purpose of determining the cost of your next attack.**
<!-- hey, maybe this shouldnt be true! i dont remember why it was important that it should be! i see why different attacks with the same weapon should not count as the same.. but why not attacks with different weapons? shouldnt those be different? anyway... one thing i dont love is that you do have to just remember how many times youve attacked in a turn... of course there could be another tracker, but no, thats stupid, one tracker is more than enough. -->

<!-- TODO: wile made a good case for the y=1 implicitly in XnY, so probably change stuff to fit, or leave this note as a reminder that that is an option! -->

#### How many scores *are* there?

Practically speaking, any given setting will only have so many scores, but the system has no opinion on what those scores can be. 

#### CON (This should just be a skill)

CON is used to resist status effects like POISON and EXHAUSTION. For every point of CON you have you can choose to ignore the effects of 1 stack of any number of status effects you have. You still have the status effect, meaning other effects that rely on that status effect can still be triggered. The ignored status effects are resolved or wear off at the same rate as they would otherwise.  

If you have 1 CON and you've been given 1 [bleed] and 3 [poison], at the beginning of the round you can choose to take 2 damage from the [poison] and ignore the [bleed]. You still have that 1[bleed] until you remove it.
