There are various python doc automation functions I want to be able to use. I'll test them here.

```{python}
# testing snippets, some from update.py, some from scratch.py
import os
from citutils import text_utils_parsers as tu
from citutils import entity_text_generators as ge

entities = tu.get_entities(os.path.join("..","..", "..","data", "entities"))

print(ge.generate_entity_text(entities["salt_wretch"]))

```
