GNOSIS is a liability as much as it is an advantage. Gnostic abilities often have more dramatic effects against those with positive GNOSIS attribute scores, and they can often be used without fulfilling some casting requirements against individuals with GNOSIS. GNOSIS is openness of the mind, and an open mind is more easily entered and manipulated. Gnostic abilities might also leverage or change their effect based on the max GNOSIS of the target, so having a higher max GNOSIS (either from your passive score or temp increases in max GNOSIS) is a liability.

GNOSIS should feel like a liability, using gnostic abilities should always feel risky. Pulling this off might involve a consequence table that is rolled on when gnostic effects are created.

GNOSIS is knowledge, information, so failed attempts to use gnostic abilities will result in the user believing things that are wrong.

Maybe at the beginning of a day, or after meditation, you "refill" your gnostic capacity up to your GNOSIS. Other items that refill your GNOSIS also raise your max GNOSIS temporarily, which can be harmful.

## scraps

There could be other informational problems that show up for GNOSIS users, weird little consequences for limited periods. Examples:

- You can no longer see things that are currently in motion.
- You cannot understand or differentiate faces.
- You forget the entire day up to this point.
- You are convinced that you are going to fall into the sky (coupled with a small probability that you, in fact, will fall into the sky if you are exposed to it).

Potentially weird stuff like:

- You are constantly sinking slowly into the ground.

This could be potentially helpful, but difficult to control, like: 

- Objects around you all start talking to you and telling you their history as they remember it.
