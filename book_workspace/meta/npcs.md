There are not enough NPCs and there is not enough interest or cohesion among npcs that exist! So there need to be goals, minimum numbers of a certain type, and then there needs to be a spec for what npc is going to fill those requirements, and then there needs to be a plan for definitely actually fucking creating them!!??
